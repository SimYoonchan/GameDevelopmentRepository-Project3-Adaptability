  - "Welcome to the <b>Adaptive Reading Series</b>! This is a tutorial explaining
    how the <b>Adaptive Reader Series</b> Software works. If you are already familiar
    with this tutorial, please feel free to press the \u201CSkip\u201D button below."
  - "To start the <b>Adaptive Reader Series</b> Software, go to the 3 buttons on
    the middle-bottom of the main screen. \n\nPress the \u2018Two-horizontal-lines\u2019
    button. This is the Play-Button. After pressing the Play-Button, a \u2018Right-facing-triangle\u2019
    button will appear. This is the Pause-Button. If you want to pause, press this
    Pause-Button.\r\n\r\nYou can also press the \u2018Space\u2019 button on your
    Keyboard to do the Play/Pause functionality for you.\r"
  - 'On the middle-bottom of the main screen, there is also a ''Circular-arrow''
    button. This button resets the adaptive reader to the start.


    Along with
    the "Play/Pause" button and the "Restart" button, there is also a ''Right-triangle-with-a-line''
    button.


    If you see this, this button takes you to the next chapter.'
  - "To fast forward in the Chapter you are reading, press and hold the number \"4\"
    on the keyboard for x1 speed, \"5\" for x2 speed and \"6\" for x3 speed.\n\r\nTo
    go backwards in the Chapter you are reading, press and hold the number \"3\"
    on the keyboard for x1 speed, \"2\" for x2 speed and \"1\" for x3 speed.\n\r"
  - "On the main screen, there is also a \u2018Three-Dots\u2019 button at the top
    right corner. By pressing this, it takes you to the Options Menu. You can also
    do this by pressing either \u2018Esc\u2019 or \u2018P\u2019 button on your keyboard.\r\n"
  - "In the Options Menu, you can make changes like the following: \u2018Average-Characters-Per-Word\u2019,
    \u2018Words-Per-Minute-Rates\u2019, and \u2018Font-Size\u2019.\r\n\r\nIncreasing
    the \u2018Average-Characters-Per-Word\u2019 and increasing the \u2018Words-Per-Minute-Rates\u2019
    will both increase the speed at which the reading occurs.\r\n\r\nBefore pressing
    Play on the main screen, we recommend that you set up the \u2018Average-Characters-Per-Word,
    \u2018Words-Per-Minute-Rates\u2019 and the \u2018Font-Size\u2019 on this Options
    Menu. Then, exit out of the Options Menu by either clicking on \u2018Resume\u2019
    or by pressing either \u2018Esc\u2019 or \u2018P\u2019 button again.\r"
  - Back on the main screen, there is a "Tutorial Icon" button on the top left. If
    you press this, you will be able to see this same tutorial again.
  - To the left of the "Tutorial Icon" button is the "Back" button. This will take
    you to the Book Hub where you can select other chapters.
  - We hope you enjoy your experience with using our <b>Adaptive Reading Series</b>
    Software!
