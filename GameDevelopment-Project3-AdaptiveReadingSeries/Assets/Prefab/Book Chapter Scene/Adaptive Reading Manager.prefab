  chapterFullText: "I slept at Baker Street that night, and we were engaged upon
    our toast and coffee in the morning when the King of Bohemia rushed into the
    room. \u201CYou have really got it!\u201D he cried, grasping Sherlock Holmes
    by either shoulder and looking eagerly into his face. \u201CNot yet.\u201D \u201CBut
    you have hopes?\u201D \u201CI have hopes.\u201D \u201CThen, come. I am all impatience
    to be gone.\u201D \u201CWe must have a cab.\u201D \u201CNo, my brougham is waiting.\u201D
    \u201CThen that will simplify matters.\u201D We descended and started off once
    more for Briony Lodge. \u201CIrene Adler is married,\u201D remarked Holmes. \u201CMarried!
    When?\u201D \u201CYesterday.\u201D \u201CBut to whom?\u201D \u201CTo an English
    lawyer named Norton.\u201D \u201CBut she could not love him.\u201D \u201CI am
    in hopes that she does.\u201D \u201CAnd why in hopes?\u201D \u201CBecause it
    would spare your Majesty all fear of future annoyance. If the lady loves her
    husband, she does not love your Majesty. If she does not love your Majesty, there
    is no reason why she should interfere with your Majesty\u2019s plan.\u201D \u201CIt
    is true. And yet\u2014! Well! I wish she had been of my own station! What a queen
    she would have made!\u201D He relapsed into a moody silence, which was not broken
    until we drew up in Serpentine Avenue. The door of Briony Lodge was open, and
    an elderly woman stood upon the steps. She watched us with a sardonic eye as
    we stepped from the brougham. \u201CMr. Sherlock Holmes, I believe?\u201D said
    she. \u201CI am Mr. Holmes,\u201D answered my companion, looking at her with
    a questioning and rather startled gaze. \u201CIndeed! My mistress told me that
    you were likely to call. She left this morning with her husband by the 5:15 train
    from Charing Cross for the Continent.\u201D \u201CWhat!\u201D Sherlock Holmes
    staggered back, white with chagrin and surprise. \u201CDo you mean that she has
    left England?\u201D \u201CNever to return.\u201D \u201CAnd the papers?\u201D
    asked the King hoarsely. \u201CAll is lost.\u201D \u201CWe shall see.\u201D He
    pushed past the servant and rushed into the drawing-room, followed by the King
    and myself. The furniture was scattered about in every direction, with dismantled
    shelves and open drawers, as if the lady had hurriedly ransacked them before
    her flight. Holmes rushed at the bell-pull, tore back a small sliding shutter,
    and, plunging in his hand, pulled out a photograph and a letter. The photograph
    was of Irene Adler herself in evening dress, the letter was superscribed to \u201CSherlock
    Holmes, Esq. To be left till called for.\u201D My friend tore it open, and we
    all three read it together. It was dated at midnight of the preceding night and
    ran in this way: \u201CMY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES,\u2014You really did it very
    well. You took me in completely. Until after the alarm of fire, I had not a suspicion.
    But then, when I found how I had betrayed myself, I began to think. I had been
    warned against you months ago. I had been told that, if the King employed an
    agent, it would certainly be you. And your address had been given me. Yet, with
    all this, you made me reveal what you wanted to know. Even after I became suspicious,
    I found it hard to think evil of such a dear, kind old clergyman. But, you know,
    I have been trained as an actress myself. Male costume is nothing new to me.
    I often take advantage of the freedom which it gives. I sent John, the coachman,
    to watch you, ran upstairs, got into my walking clothes, as I call them, and
    came down just as you departed. \u201CWell, I followed you to your door, and
    so made sure that I was really an object of interest to the celebrated Mr. Sherlock
    Holmes. Then I, rather imprudently, wished you good-night, and started for the
    Temple to see my husband. \u201CWe both thought the best resource was flight,
    when pursued by so formidable an antagonist; so you will find the nest empty
    when you call to-morrow. As to the photograph, your client may rest in peace.
    I love and am loved by a better man than he. The King may do what he will without
    hindrance from one whom he has cruelly wronged. I keep it only to safeguard myself,
    and to preserve a weapon which will always secure me from any steps which he
    might take in the future. I leave a photograph which he might care to possess;
    and I remain, dear Mr. Sherlock Holmes, \u201CVery truly yours, \u201CIRENE NORTON,
    n\xE9e ADLER.\u201D \u201CWhat a woman\u2014oh, what a woman!\u201D cried the
    King of Bohemia, when we had all three read this epistle. \u201CDid I not tell
    you how quick and resolute she was? Would she not have made an admirable queen?
    Is it not a pity that she was not on my level?\u201D \u201CFrom what I have seen
    of the lady, she seems, indeed, to be on a very different level to your Majesty,\u201D
    said Holmes coldly. \u201CI am sorry that I have not been able to bring your
    Majesty\u2019s business to a more successful conclusion.\u201D \u201COn the contrary,
    my dear sir,\u201D cried the King; \u201Cnothing could be more successful. I
    know that her word is inviolate. The photograph is now as safe as if it were
    in the fire.\u201D \u201CI am glad to hear your Majesty say so.\u201D \u201CI
    am immensely indebted to you. Pray tell me in what way I can reward you. This
    ring\u2014\u201D He slipped an emerald snake ring from his finger and held it
    out upon the palm of his hand. \u201CYour Majesty has something which I should
    value even more highly,\u201D said Holmes. \u201CYou have but to name it.\u201D
    \u201CThis photograph!\u201D The King stared at him in amazement. \u201CIrene\u2019s
    photograph!\u201D he cried. \u201CCertainly, if you wish it.\u201D \u201CI thank
    your Majesty. Then there is no more to be done in the matter. I have the honour
    to wish you a very good morning.\u201D He bowed, and, turning away without observing
    the hand which the King had stretched out to him, he set off in my company for
    his chambers. And that was how a great scandal threatened to affect the kingdom
    of Bohemia, and how the best plans of Mr. Sherlock Holmes were beaten by a woman\u2019s
    wit. He used to make merry over the cleverness of women, but I have not heard
    him do it of late. And when he speaks of Irene Adler, or when he refers to her
    photograph, it is always under the honourable title of the woman."
