  m_text: "Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the
    bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book
    her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, \u201Cand
    what is the use of a book,\u201D thought Alice \u201Cwithout pictures or conversations?\u201D
    So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day
    made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain
    would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly
    a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her. There was nothing so very remarkable
    in that; nor did Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit
    say to itself, \u201COh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!\u201D (when she thought
    it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this,
    but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually took
    a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice
    started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before
    seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and
    burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was
    just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge. In another
    moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she
    was to get out again. The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some
    way, and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to
    think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep
    well. Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty
    of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen
    next. First, she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to, but
    it was too dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and
    noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves; here and there
    she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the
    shelves as she passed; it was labelled \u201CORANGE MARMALADE\u201D, but to her
    great disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear
    of killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards
    as she fell past it. \u201CWell!\u201D thought Alice to herself, \u201Cafter
    such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave
    they\u2019ll all think me at home! Why, I wouldn\u2019t say anything about it,
    even if I fell off the top of the house!\u201D (Which was very likely true.)
    Down, down, down. Would the fall never come to an end? \u201CI wonder how many
    miles I\u2019ve fallen by this time?\u201D she said aloud. \u201CI must be getting
    somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four thousand
    miles down, I think\u2014\u201D (for, you see, Alice had learnt several things
    of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a very
    good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to listen
    to her, still it was good practice to say it over) \u201C\u2014yes, that\u2019s
    about the right distance\u2014but then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I\u2019ve
    got to?\u201D (Alice had no idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but
    thought they were nice grand words to say.) Presently she began again. \u201CI
    wonder if I shall fall right through the earth! How funny it\u2019ll seem to
    come out among the people that walk with their heads downward! The Antipathies,
    I think\u2014\u201D (she was rather glad there was no one listening, this time,
    as it didn\u2019t sound at all the right word) \u201C\u2014but I shall have to
    ask them what the name of the country is, you know. Please, Ma\u2019am, is this
    New Zealand or Australia?\u201D (and she tried to curtsey as she spoke\u2014fancy
    curtseying as you\u2019re falling through the air! Do you think you could manage
    it?) \u201CAnd what an ignorant little girl she\u2019ll think me for asking!
    No, it\u2019ll never do to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.\u201D
    Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began talking again.
    \u201CDinah\u2019ll miss me very much to-night, I should think!\u201D (Dinah
    was the cat.) \u201CI hope they\u2019ll remember her saucer of milk at tea-time.
    Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are no mice in the air,
    I\u2019m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that\u2019s very like a mouse,
    you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?\u201D And here Alice began to get rather
    sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of way, \u201CDo cats
    eat bats? Do cats eat bats?\u201D and sometimes, \u201CDo bats eat cats?\u201D
    for, you see, as she couldn\u2019t answer either question, it didn\u2019t much
    matter which way she put it. She felt that she was dozing off, and had just begun
    to dream that she was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very
    earnestly, \u201CNow, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?\u201D
    when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves,
    and the fall was over. Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her
    feet in a moment: she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was
    another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down
    it. There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and was
    just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, \u201COh my ears and whiskers,
    how late it\u2019s getting!\u201D She was close behind it when she turned the
    corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found herself in a long,
    low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof. There were
    doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when Alice had been all
    the way down one side and up the other, trying every door, she walked sadly down
    the middle, wondering how she was ever to get out again. Suddenly she came upon
    a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass; there was nothing on it
    except a tiny golden key, and Alice\u2019s first thought was that it might belong
    to one of the doors of the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large,
    or the key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of them. However,
    on the second time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before,
    and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the little
    golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted! Alice opened the
    door and found that it led into a small passage, not much larger than a rat-hole:
    she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever
    saw. How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about among those
    beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her
    head through the doorway; \u201Cand even if my head would go through,\u201D thought
    poor Alice, \u201Cit would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh, how
    I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only knew how
    to begin.\u201D For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately,
    that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible.
    There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went back to
    the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at any rate a book
    of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this time she found a little
    bottle on it, (\u201Cwhich certainly was not here before,\u201D said Alice,)
    and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the words \u201CDRINK
    ME,\u201D beautifully printed on it in large letters. It was all very well to
    say \u201CDrink me,\u201D but the wise little Alice was not going to do that
    in a hurry. \u201CNo, I\u2019ll look first,\u201D she said, \u201Cand see whether
    it\u2019s marked \u2018poison\u2019 or not\u201D; for she had read several nice
    little histories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts
    and other unpleasant things, all because they would not remember the simple rules
    their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if
    you hold it too long; and that if you cut your finger very deeply with a knife,
    it usually bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a
    bottle marked \u201Cpoison,\u201D it is almost certain to disagree with you,
    sooner or later. However, this bottle was not marked \u201Cpoison,\u201D so Alice
    ventured to taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed
    flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and hot buttered
    toast,) she very soon finished it off. ********** \u201CWhat a curious feeling!\u201D
    said Alice; \u201CI must be shutting up like a telescope.\u201D And so it was
    indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face brightened up at the thought
    that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely
    garden. First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going
    to shrink any further: she felt a little nervous about this; \u201Cfor it might
    end, you know,\u201D said Alice to herself, \u201Cin my going out altogether,
    like a candle. I wonder what I should be like then?\u201D And she tried to fancy
    what the flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could
    not remember ever having seen such a thing. After a while, finding that nothing
    more happened, she decided on going into the garden at once; but, alas for poor
    Alice! when she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the little golden
    key, and when she went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly
    reach it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her
    best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery; and when
    she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried.
    \u201CCome, there\u2019s no use in crying like that!\u201D said Alice to herself,
    rather sharply; \u201CI advise you to leave off this minute!\u201D She generally
    gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it), and sometimes
    she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she
    remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game of
    croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious child was very fond
    of pretending to be two people. \u201CBut it\u2019s no use now,\u201D thought
    poor Alice, \u201Cto pretend to be two people! Why, there\u2019s hardly enough
    of me left to make one respectable person!\u201D Soon her eye fell on a little
    glass box that was lying under the table: she opened it, and found in it a very
    small cake, on which the words \u201CEAT ME\u201D were beautifully marked in
    currants. \u201CWell, I\u2019ll eat it,\u201D said Alice, \u201Cand if it makes
    me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep
    under the door; so either way I\u2019ll get into the garden, and I don\u2019t
    care which happens!\u201D She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself,
    \u201CWhich way? Which way?\u201D, holding her hand on the top of her head to
    feel which way it was growing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained
    the same size: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice
    had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to
    happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common
    way. So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake."
