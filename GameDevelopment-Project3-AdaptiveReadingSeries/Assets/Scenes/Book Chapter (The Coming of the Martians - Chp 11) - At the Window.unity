      value: "I have already said that my storms of emotion have a trick of exhausting
        themselves. After a time I discovered that I was cold and wet, and with little
        pools of water about me on the stair carpet. I got up almost mechanically,
        went into the dining room and drank some whisky, and then I was moved to
        change my clothes. After I had done that I went upstairs to my study, but
        why I did so I do not know. The window of my study looks over the trees and
        the railway towards Horsell Common. In the hurry of our departure this window
        had been left open. The passage was dark, and, by contrast with the picture
        the window frame enclosed, the side of the room seemed impenetrably dark.
        I stopped short in the doorway. The thunderstorm had passed. The towers of
        the Oriental College and the pine trees about it had gone, and very far away,
        lit by a vivid red glare, the common about the sand-pits was visible. Across
        the light huge black shapes, grotesque and strange, moved busily to and fro.
        It seemed indeed as if the whole country in that direction was on fire\u2014a
        broad hillside set with minute tongues of flame, swaying and writhing with
        the gusts of the dying storm, and throwing a red reflection upon the cloud
        scud above. Every now and then a haze of smoke from some nearer conflagration
        drove across the window and hid the Martian shapes. I could not see what
        they were doing, nor the clear form of them, nor recognise the black objects
        they were busied upon. Neither could I see the nearer fire, though the reflections
        of it danced on the wall and ceiling of the study. A sharp, resinous tang
        of burning was in the air. I closed the door noiselessly and crept towards
        the window. As I did so, the view opened out until, on the one hand, it reached
        to the houses about Woking station, and on the other to the charred and blackened
        pine woods of Byfleet. There was a light down below the hill, on the railway,
        near the arch, and several of the houses along the Maybury road and the streets
        near the station were glowing ruins. The light upon the railway puzzled me
        at first; there were a black heap and a vivid glare, and to the right of
        that a row of yellow oblongs. Then I perceived this was a wrecked train,
        the fore part smashed and on fire, the hinder carriages still upon the rails.
        Between these three main centres of light\u2014the houses, the train, and
        the burning county towards Chobham\u2014stretched irregular patches of dark
        country, broken here and there by intervals of dimly glowing and smoking
        ground. It was the strangest spectacle, that black expanse set with fire.
        It reminded me, more than anything else, of the Potteries at night. At first
        I could distinguish no people at all, though I peered intently for them.
        Later I saw against the light of Woking station a number of black figures
        hurrying one after the other across the line. And this was the little world
        in which I had been living securely for years, this fiery chaos! What had
        happened in the last seven hours I still did not know; nor did I know, though
        I was beginning to guess, the relation between these mechanical colossi and
        the sluggish lumps I had seen disgorged from the cylinder. With a queer feeling
        of impersonal interest I turned my desk chair to the window, sat down, and
        stared at the blackened country, and particularly at the three gigantic black
        things that were going to and fro in the glare about the sand-pits. They
        seemed amazingly busy. I began to ask myself what they could be. Were they
        intelligent mechanisms? Such a thing I felt was impossible. Or did a Martian
        sit within each, ruling, directing, using, much as a man\u2019s brain sits
        and rules in his body? I began to compare the things to human machines, to
        ask myself for the first time in my life how an ironclad or a steam engine
        would seem to an intelligent lower animal. The storm had left the sky clear,
        and over the smoke of the burning land the little fading pinpoint of Mars
        was dropping into the west, when a soldier came into my garden. I heard a
        slight scraping at the fence, and rousing myself from the lethargy that had
        fallen upon me, I looked down and saw him dimly, clambering over the palings.
        At the sight of another human being my torpor passed, and I leaned out of
        the window eagerly. \u201CHist!\u201D said I, in a whisper. He stopped astride
        of the fence in doubt. Then he came over and across the lawn to the corner
        of the house. He bent down and stepped softly. \u201CWho\u2019s there?\u201D
        he said, also whispering, standing under the window and peering up. \u201CWhere
        are you going?\u201D I asked. \u201CGod knows.\u201D \u201CAre you trying
        to hide?\u201D \u201CThat\u2019s it.\u201D \u201CCome into the house,\u201D
        I said. I went down, unfastened the door, and let him in, and locked the
        door again. I could not see his face. He was hatless, and his coat was unbuttoned.
        \u201CMy God!\u201D he said, as I drew him in. \u201CWhat has happened?\u201D
        I asked. \u201CWhat hasn\u2019t?\u201D In the obscurity I could see he made
        a gesture of despair. \u201CThey wiped us out\u2014simply wiped us out,\u201D
        he repeated again and again. He followed me, almost mechanically, into the
        dining room. \u201CTake some whisky,\u201D I said, pouring out a stiff dose.
        He drank it. Then abruptly he sat down before the table, put his head on
        his arms, and began to sob and weep like a little boy, in a perfect passion
        of emotion, while I, with a curious forgetfulness of my own recent despair,
        stood beside him, wondering. It was a long time before he could steady his
        nerves to answer my questions, and then he answered perplexingly and brokenly.
        He was a driver in the artillery, and had only come into action about seven.
        At that time firing was going on across the common, and it was said the first
        party of Martians were crawling slowly towards their second cylinder under
        cover of a metal shield. Later this shield staggered up on tripod legs and
        became the first of the fighting-machines I had seen. The gun he drove had
        been unlimbered near Horsell, in order to command the sand-pits, and its
        arrival it was that had precipitated the action. As the limber gunners went
        to the rear, his horse trod in a rabbit hole and came down, throwing him
        into a depression of the ground. At the same moment the gun exploded behind
        him, the ammunition blew up, there was fire all about him, and he found himself
        lying under a heap of charred dead men and dead horses. \u201CI lay still,\u201D
        he said, \u201Cscared out of my wits, with the fore quarter of a horse atop
        of me. We\u2019d been wiped out. And the smell\u2014good God! Like burnt
        meat! I was hurt across the back by the fall of the horse, and there I had
        to lie until I felt better. Just like parade it had been a minute before\u2014then
        stumble, bang, swish!\u201D \u201CWiped out!\u201D he said. He had hid under
        the dead horse for a long time, peeping out furtively across the common.
        The Cardigan men had tried a rush, in skirmishing order, at the pit, simply
        to be swept out of existence. Then the monster had risen to its feet and
        had begun to walk leisurely to and fro across the common among the few fugitives,
        with its headlike hood turning about exactly like the head of a cowled human
        being. A kind of arm carried a complicated metallic case, about which green
        flashes scintillated, and out of the funnel of this there smoked the Heat-Ray.
        In a few minutes there was, so far as the soldier could see, not a living
        thing left upon the common, and every bush and tree upon it that was not
        already a blackened skeleton was burning. The hussars had been on the road
        beyond the curvature of the ground, and he saw nothing of them. He heard
        the Maxims rattle for a time and then become still. The giant saved Woking
        station and its cluster of houses until the last; then in a moment the Heat-Ray
        was brought to bear, and the town became a heap of fiery ruins. Then the
        Thing shut off the Heat-Ray, and turning its back upon the artilleryman,
        began to waddle away towards the smouldering pine woods that sheltered the
        second cylinder. As it did so a second glittering Titan built itself up out
        of the pit. The second monster followed the first, and at that the artilleryman
        began to crawl very cautiously across the hot heather ash towards Horsell.
        He managed to get alive into the ditch by the side of the road, and so escaped
        to Woking. There his story became ejaculatory. The place was impassable.
        It seems there were a few people alive there, frantic for the most part and
        many burned and scalded. He was turned aside by the fire, and hid among some
        almost scorching heaps of broken wall as one of the Martian giants returned.
        He saw this one pursue a man, catch him up in one of its steely tentacles,
        and knock his head against the trunk of a pine tree. At last, after nightfall,
        the artilleryman made a rush for it and got over the railway embankment.
        Since then he had been skulking along towards Maybury, in the hope of getting
        out of danger Londonward. People were hiding in trenches and cellars, and
        many of the survivors had made off towards Woking village and Send. He had
        been consumed with thirst until he found one of the water mains near the
        railway arch smashed, and the water bubbling out like a spring upon the road.
        That was the story I got from him, bit by bit. He grew calmer telling me
        and trying to make me see the things he had seen. He had eaten no food since
        midday, he told me early in his narrative, and I found some mutton and bread
        in the pantry and brought it into the room. We lit no lamp for fear of attracting
        the Martians, and ever and again our hands would touch upon bread or meat.
        As he talked, things about us came darkly out of the darkness, and the trampled
        bushes and broken rose trees outside the window grew distinct. It would seem
        that a number of men or animals had rushed across the lawn. I began to see
        his face, blackened and haggard, as no doubt mine was also. When we had finished
        eating we went softly upstairs to my study, and I looked again out of the
        open window. In one night the valley had become a valley of ashes. The fires
        had dwindled now. Where flames had been there were now streamers of smoke;
        but the countless ruins of shattered and gutted houses and blasted and blackened
        trees that the night had hidden stood out now gaunt and terrible in the pitiless
        light of dawn. Yet here and there some object had had the luck to escape\u2014a
        white railway signal here, the end of a greenhouse there, white and fresh
        amid the wreckage. Never before in the history of warfare had destruction
        been so indiscriminate and so universal. And shining with the growing light
        of the east, three of the metallic giants stood about the pit, their cowls
        rotating as though they were surveying the desolation they had made. It seemed
        to me that the pit had been enlarged, and ever and again puffs of vivid green
        vapour streamed up and out of it towards the brightening dawn\u2014streamed
        up, whirled, broke, and vanished. Beyond were the pillars of fire about Chobham.
        They became pillars of bloodshot smoke at the first touch of day."
