      value: "No one would have believed in the last years of the nineteenth century
        that this world was being watched keenly and closely by intelligences greater
        than man\u2019s and yet as mortal as his own; that as men busied themselves
        about their various concerns they were scrutinised and studied, perhaps almost
        as narrowly as a man with a microscope might scrutinise the transient creatures
        that swarm and multiply in a drop of water. With infinite complacency men
        went to and from over this globe about their little affairs, serene in their
        assurance of their empire over matter. It is possible that the infusoria
        under the microscope do the same. No one gave a thought to the older worlds
        of space as sources of human danger, or thought of them only to dismiss the
        idea of life upon them as impossible or improbable. It is curious to recall
        some of the mental habits of those departed days. At most terrestrial men
        fancied there might be other men upon Mars, perhaps inferior to themselves
        and ready to welcome a missionary enterprise. Yet across the gulf of space,
        minds that are to our minds as ours are to those of the beasts that perish,
        intellects vast and cool and unsympathetic, regarded this earth with envious
        eyes, and slowly and surely drew their plans against us. And early in the
        twentieth century came the great disillusionment. The planet Mars, I scarcely
        need remind the reader, revolves about the sun at a mean distance of 140,000,000
        miles, and the light and heat it receives from the sun is barely half of
        that received by this world. It must be, if the nebular hypothesis has any
        truth, older than our world; and long before this earth ceased to be molten,
        life upon its surface must have begun its course. The fact that it is scarcely
        one seventh of the volume of the earth must have accelerated its cooling
        to the temperature at which life could begin. It has air and water and all
        that is necessary for the support of animated existence. Yet so vain is man,
        and so blinded by his vanity, that no writer, up to the very end of the nineteenth
        century, expressed any idea that intelligent life might have developed there
        far, or indeed at all, beyond its earthly level. Nor was it generally understood
        that since Mars is older than our earth, with scarcely a quarter of the superficial
        area and remoter from the sun, it necessarily follows that it is not only
        more distant from time\u2019s beginning but nearer its end. The secular cooling
        that must someday overtake our planet has already gone far indeed with our
        neighbour. Its physical condition is still largely a mystery, but we know
        now that even in its equatorial region the midday temperature barely approaches
        that of our coldest winter. Its air is much more attenuated than ours, its
        oceans have shrunk until they cover but a third of its surface, and as its
        slow seasons change huge snowcaps gather and melt about either pole and periodically
        inundate its temperate zones. That last stage of exhaustion, which to us
        is still incredibly remote, has become a present-day problem for the inhabitants
        of Mars. The immediate pressure of necessity has brightened their intellects,
        enlarged their powers, and hardened their hearts. And looking across space
        with instruments, and intelligences such as we have scarcely dreamed of,
        they see, at its nearest distance only 35,000,000 of miles sunward of them,
        a morning star of hope, our own warmer planet, green with vegetation and
        grey with water, with a cloudy atmosphere eloquent of fertility, with glimpses
        through its drifting cloud wisps of broad stretches of populous country and
        narrow, navy-crowded seas. And we men, the creatures who inhabit this earth,
        must be to them at least as alien and lowly as are the monkeys and lemurs
        to us. The intellectual side of man already admits that life is an incessant
        struggle for existence, and it would seem that this too is the belief of
        the minds upon Mars. Their world is far gone in its cooling and this world
        is still crowded with life, but crowded only with what they regard as inferior
        animals. To carry warfare sunward is, indeed, their only escape from the
        destruction that, generation after generation, creeps upon them. And before
        we judge of them too harshly we must remember what ruthless and utter destruction
        our own species has wrought, not only upon animals, such as the vanished
        bison and the dodo, but upon its inferior races. The Tasmanians, in spite
        of their human likeness, were entirely swept out of existence in a war of
        extermination waged by European immigrants, in the space of fifty years.
        Are we such apostles of mercy as to complain if the Martians warred in the
        same spirit? The Martians seem to have calculated their descent with amazing
        subtlety\u2014their mathematical learning is evidently far in excess of ours\u2014and
        to have carried out their preparations with a well-nigh perfect unanimity.
        Had our instruments permitted it, we might have seen the gathering trouble
        far back in the nineteenth century. Men like Schiaparelli watched the red
        planet\u2014it is odd, by-the-bye, that for countless centuries Mars has
        been the star of war\u2014but failed to interpret the fluctuating appearances
        of the markings they mapped so well. All that time the Martians must have
        been getting ready. During the opposition of 1894 a great light was seen
        on the illuminated part of the disk, first at the Lick Observatory, then
        by Perrotin of Nice, and then by other observers. English readers heard of
        it first in the issue of Nature dated August 2. I am inclined to think that
        this blaze may have been the casting of the huge gun, in the vast pit sunk
        into their planet, from which their shots were fired at us. Peculiar markings,
        as yet unexplained, were seen near the site of that outbreak during the next
        two oppositions. The storm burst upon us six years ago now. As Mars approached
        opposition, Lavelle of Java set the wires of the astronomical exchange palpitating
        with the amazing intelligence of a huge outbreak of incandescent gas upon
        the planet. It had occurred towards midnight of the twelfth; and the spectroscope,
        to which he had at once resorted, indicated a mass of flaming gas, chiefly
        hydrogen, moving with an enormous velocity towards this earth. This jet of
        fire had become invisible about a quarter past twelve. He compared it to
        a colossal puff of flame suddenly and violently squirted out of the planet,
        \u201Cas flaming gases rushed out of a gun.\u201D A singularly appropriate
        phrase it proved. Yet the next day there was nothing of this in the papers
        except a little note in the Daily Telegraph, and the world went in ignorance
        of one of the gravest dangers that ever threatened the human race. I might
        not have heard of the eruption at all had I not met Ogilvy, the well-known
        astronomer, at Ottershaw. He was immensely excited at the news, and in the
        excess of his feelings invited me up to take a turn with him that night in
        a scrutiny of the red planet. In spite of all that has happened since, I
        still remember that vigil very distinctly: the black and silent observatory,
        the shadowed lantern throwing a feeble glow upon the floor in the corner,
        the steady ticking of the clockwork of the telescope, the little slit in
        the roof\u2014an oblong profundity with the stardust streaked across it.
        Ogilvy moved about, invisible but audible. Looking through the telescope,
        one saw a circle of deep blue and the little round planet swimming in the
        field. It seemed such a little thing, so bright and small and still, faintly
        marked with transverse stripes, and slightly flattened from the perfect round.
        But so little it was, so silvery warm\u2014a pin\u2019s head of light! It
        was as if it quivered, but really this was the telescope vibrating with the
        activity of the clockwork that kept the planet in view. As I watched, the
        planet seemed to grow larger and smaller and to advance and recede, but that
        was simply that my eye was tired. Forty millions of miles it was from us\u2014more
        than forty millions of miles of void. Few people realise the immensity of
        vacancy in which the dust of the material universe swims. Near it in the
        field, I remember, were three faint points of light, three telescopic stars
        infinitely remote, and all around it was the unfathomable darkness of empty
        space. You know how that blackness looks on a frosty starlight night. In
        a telescope it seems far profounder. And invisible to me because it was so
        remote and small, flying swiftly and steadily towards me across that incredible
        distance, drawing nearer every minute by so many thousands of miles, came
        the Thing they were sending us, the Thing that was to bring so much struggle
        and calamity and death to the earth. I never dreamed of it then as I watched;
        no one on earth dreamed of that unerring missile. That night, too, there
        was another jetting out of gas from the distant planet. I saw it. A reddish
        flash at the edge, the slightest projection of the outline just as the chronometer
        struck midnight; and at that I told Ogilvy and he took my place. The night
        was warm and I was thirsty, and I went stretching my legs clumsily and feeling
        my way in the darkness, to the little table where the siphon stood, while
        Ogilvy exclaimed at the streamer of gas that came out towards us. That night
        another invisible missile started on its way to the earth from Mars, just
        a second or so under twenty-four hours after the first one. I remember how
        I sat on the table there in the blackness, with patches of green and crimson
        swimming before my eyes. I wished I had a light to smoke by, little suspecting
        the meaning of the minute gleam I had seen and all that it would presently
        bring me. Ogilvy watched till one, and then gave it up; and we lit the lantern
        and walked over to his house. Down below in the darkness were Ottershaw and
        Chertsey and all their hundreds of people, sleeping in peace. He was full
        of speculation that night about the condition of Mars, and scoffed at the
        vulgar idea of its having inhabitants who were signalling us. His idea was
        that meteorites might be falling in a heavy shower upon the planet, or that
        a huge volcanic explosion was in progress. He pointed out to me how unlikely
        it was that organic evolution had taken the same direction in the two adjacent
        planets. \u201CThe chances against anything manlike on Mars are a million
        to one,\u201D he said. Hundreds of observers saw the flame that night and
        the night after about midnight, and again the night after; and so for ten
        nights, a flame each night. Why the shots ceased after the tenth no one on
        earth has attempted to explain. It may be the gases of the firing caused
        the Martians inconvenience. Dense clouds of smoke or dust, visible through
        a powerful telescope on earth as little grey, fluctuating patches, spread
        through the clearness of the planet\u2019s atmosphere and obscured its more
        familiar features. Even the daily papers woke up to the disturbances at last,
        and popular notes appeared here, there, and everywhere concerning the volcanoes
        upon Mars. The seriocomic periodical Punch, I remember, made a happy use
        of it in the political cartoon. And, all unsuspected, those missiles the
        Martians had fired at us drew earthward, rushing now at a pace of many miles
        a second through the empty gulf of space, hour by hour and day by day, nearer
        and nearer. It seems to me now almost incredibly wonderful that, with that
        swift fate hanging over us, men could go about their petty concerns as they
        did. I remember how jubilant Markham was at securing a new photograph of
        the planet for the illustrated paper he edited in those days. People in these
        latter times scarcely realise the abundance and enterprise of our nineteenth-century
        papers. For my own part, I was much occupied in learning to ride the bicycle,
        and busy upon a series of papers discussing the probable developments of
        moral ideas as civilisation progressed. One night (the first missile then
        could scarcely have been 10,000,000 miles away) I went for a walk with my
        wife. It was starlight and I explained the Signs of the Zodiac to her, and
        pointed out Mars, a bright dot of light creeping zenithward, towards which
        so many telescopes were pointed. It was a warm night. Coming home, a party
        of excursionists from Chertsey or Isleworth passed us singing and playing
        music. There were lights in the upper windows of the houses as the people
        went to bed. From the railway station in the distance came the sound of shunting
        trains, ringing and rumbling, softened almost into melody by the distance.
        My wife pointed out to me the brightness of the red, green, and yellow signal
        lights hanging in a framework against the sky. It seemed so safe and tranquil."
