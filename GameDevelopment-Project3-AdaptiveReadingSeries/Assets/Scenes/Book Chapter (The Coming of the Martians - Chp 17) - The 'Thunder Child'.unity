      value: "Had the Martians aimed only at destruction, they might on Monday have
        annihilated the entire population of London, as it spread itself slowly through
        the home counties. Not only along the road through Barnet, but also through
        Edgware and Waltham Abbey, and along the roads eastward to Southend and Shoeburyness,
        and south of the Thames to Deal and Broadstairs, poured the same frantic
        rout. If one could have hung that June morning in a balloon in the blazing
        blue above London every northward and eastward road running out of the tangled
        maze of streets would have seemed stippled black with the streaming fugitives,
        each dot a human agony of terror and physical distress. I have set forth
        at length in the last chapter my brother\u2019s account of the road through
        Chipping Barnet, in order that my readers may realise how that swarming of
        black dots appeared to one of those concerned. Never before in the history
        of the world had such a mass of human beings moved and suffered together.
        The legendary hosts of Goths and Huns, the hugest armies Asia has ever seen,
        would have been but a drop in that current. And this was no disciplined march;
        it was a stampede\u2014a stampede gigantic and terrible\u2014without order
        and without a goal, six million people unarmed and unprovisioned, driving
        headlong. It was the beginning of the rout of civilisation, of the massacre
        of mankind. Directly below him the balloonist would have seen the network
        of streets far and wide, houses, churches, squares, crescents, gardens\u2014already
        derelict\u2014spread out like a huge map, and in the southward blotted. Over
        Ealing, Richmond, Wimbledon, it would have seemed as if some monstrous pen
        had flung ink upon the chart. Steadily, incessantly, each black splash grew
        and spread, shooting out ramifications this way and that, now banking itself
        against rising ground, now pouring swiftly over a crest into a new-found
        valley, exactly as a gout of ink would spread itself upon blotting paper.
        And beyond, over the blue hills that rise southward of the river, the glittering
        Martians went to and fro, calmly and methodically spreading their poison
        cloud over this patch of country and then over that, laying it again with
        their steam jets when it had served its purpose, and taking possession of
        the conquered country. They do not seem to have aimed at extermination so
        much as at complete demoralisation and the destruction of any opposition.
        They exploded any stores of powder they came upon, cut every telegraph, and
        wrecked the railways here and there. They were hamstringing mankind. They
        seemed in no hurry to extend the field of their operations, and did not come
        beyond the central part of London all that day. It is possible that a very
        considerable number of people in London stuck to their houses through Monday
        morning. Certain it is that many died at home suffocated by the Black Smoke.
        Until about midday the Pool of London was an astonishing scene. Steamboats
        and shipping of all sorts lay there, tempted by the enormous sums of money
        offered by fugitives, and it is said that many who swam out to these vessels
        were thrust off with boathooks and drowned. About one o\u2019clock in the
        afternoon the thinning remnant of a cloud of the black vapour appeared between
        the arches of Blackfriars Bridge. At that the Pool became a scene of mad
        confusion, fighting, and collision, and for some time a multitude of boats
        and barges jammed in the northern arch of the Tower Bridge, and the sailors
        and lightermen had to fight savagely against the people who swarmed upon
        them from the riverfront. People were actually clambering down the piers
        of the bridge from above. When, an hour later, a Martian appeared beyond
        the Clock Tower and waded down the river, nothing but wreckage floated above
        Limehouse. Of the falling of the fifth cylinder I have presently to tell.
        The sixth star fell at Wimbledon. My brother, keeping watch beside the women
        in the chaise in a meadow, saw the green flash of it far beyond the hills.
        On Tuesday the little party, still set upon getting across the sea, made
        its way through the swarming country towards Colchester. The news that the
        Martians were now in possession of the whole of London was confirmed. They
        had been seen at Highgate, and even, it was said, at Neasden. But they did
        not come into my brother\u2019s view until the morrow. That day the scattered
        multitudes began to realise the urgent need of provisions. As they grew hungry
        the rights of property ceased to be regarded. Farmers were out to defend
        their cattle-sheds, granaries, and ripening root crops with arms in their
        hands. A number of people now, like my brother, had their faces eastward,
        and there were some desperate souls even going back towards London to get
        food. These were chiefly people from the northern suburbs, whose knowledge
        of the Black Smoke came by hearsay. He heard that about half the members
        of the government had gathered at Birmingham, and that enormous quantities
        of high explosives were being prepared to be used in automatic mines across
        the Midland counties. He was also told that the Midland Railway Company had
        replaced the desertions of the first day\u2019s panic, had resumed traffic,
        and was running northward trains from St. Albans to relieve the congestion
        of the home counties. There was also a placard in Chipping Ongar announcing
        that large stores of flour were available in the northern towns and that
        within twenty-four hours bread would be distributed among the starving people
        in the neighbourhood. But this intelligence did not deter him from the plan
        of escape he had formed, and the three pressed eastward all day, and heard
        no more of the bread distribution than this promise. Nor, as a matter of
        fact, did anyone else hear more of it. That night fell the seventh star,
        falling upon Primrose Hill. It fell while Miss Elphinstone was watching,
        for she took that duty alternately with my brother. She saw it. On Wednesday
        the three fugitives\u2014they had passed the night in a field of unripe wheat\u2014reached
        Chelmsford, and there a body of the inhabitants, calling itself the Committee
        of Public Supply, seized the pony as provisions, and would give nothing in
        exchange for it but the promise of a share in it the next day. Here there
        were rumours of Martians at Epping, and news of the destruction of Waltham
        Abbey Powder Mills in a vain attempt to blow up one of the invaders. People
        were watching for Martians here from the church towers. My brother, very
        luckily for him as it chanced, preferred to push on at once to the coast
        rather than wait for food, although all three of them were very hungry. By
        midday they passed through Tillingham, which, strangely enough, seemed to
        be quite silent and deserted, save for a few furtive plunderers hunting for
        food. Near Tillingham they suddenly came in sight of the sea, and the most
        amazing crowd of shipping of all sorts that it is possible to imagine. For
        after the sailors could no longer come up the Thames, they came on to the
        Essex coast, to Harwich and Walton and Clacton, and afterwards to Foulness
        and Shoebury, to bring off the people. They lay in a huge sickle-shaped curve
        that vanished into mist at last towards the Naze. Close inshore was a multitude
        of fishing smacks\u2014English, Scotch, French, Dutch, and Swedish; steam
        launches from the Thames, yachts, electric boats; and beyond were ships of
        larger burden, a multitude of filthy colliers, trim merchantmen, cattle ships,
        passenger boats, petroleum tanks, ocean tramps, an old white transport even,
        neat white and grey liners from Southampton and Hamburg; and along the blue
        coast across the Blackwater my brother could make out dimly a dense swarm
        of boats chaffering with the people on the beach, a swarm which also extended
        up the Blackwater almost to Maldon. About a couple of miles out lay an ironclad,
        very low in the water, almost, to my brother\u2019s perception, like a water-logged
        ship. This was the ram Thunder Child. It was the only warship in sight, but
        far away to the right over the smooth surface of the sea\u2014for that day
        there was a dead calm\u2014lay a serpent of black smoke to mark the next
        ironclads of the Channel Fleet, which hovered in an extended line, steam
        up and ready for action, across the Thames estuary during the course of the
        Martian conquest, vigilant and yet powerless to prevent it. At the sight
        of the sea, Mrs. Elphinstone, in spite of the assurances of her sister-in-law,
        gave way to panic. She had never been out of England before, she would rather
        die than trust herself friendless in a foreign country, and so forth. She
        seemed, poor woman, to imagine that the French and the Martians might prove
        very similar. She had been growing increasingly hysterical, fearful, and
        depressed during the two days\u2019 journeyings. Her great idea was to return
        to Stanmore. Things had been always well and safe at Stanmore. They would
        find George at Stanmore.... It was with the greatest difficulty they could
        get her down to the beach, where presently my brother succeeded in attracting
        the attention of some men on a paddle steamer from the Thames. They sent
        a boat and drove a bargain for thirty-six pounds for the three. The steamer
        was going, these men said, to Ostend. It was about two o\u2019clock when
        my brother, having paid their fares at the gangway, found himself safely
        aboard the steamboat with his charges. There was food aboard, albeit at exorbitant
        prices, and the three of them contrived to eat a meal on one of the seats
        forward. There were already a couple of score of passengers aboard, some
        of whom had expended their last money in securing a passage, but the captain
        lay off the Blackwater until five in the afternoon, picking up passengers
        until the seated decks were even dangerously crowded. He would probably have
        remained longer had it not been for the sound of guns that began about that
        hour in the south. As if in answer, the ironclad seaward fired a small gun
        and hoisted a string of flags. A jet of smoke sprang out of her funnels.
        Some of the passengers were of opinion that this firing came from Shoeburyness,
        until it was noticed that it was growing louder. At the same time, far away
        in the southeast the masts and upperworks of three ironclads rose one after
        the other out of the sea, beneath clouds of black smoke. But my brother\u2019s
        attention speedily reverted to the distant firing in the south. He fancied
        he saw a column of smoke rising out of the distant grey haze. The little
        steamer was already flapping her way eastward of the big crescent of shipping,
        and the low Essex coast was growing blue and hazy, when a Martian appeared,
        small and faint in the remote distance, advancing along the muddy coast from
        the direction of Foulness. At that the captain on the bridge swore at the
        top of his voice with fear and anger at his own delay, and the paddles seemed
        infected with his terror. Every soul aboard stood at the bulwarks or on the
        seats of the steamer and stared at that distant shape, higher than the trees
        or church towers inland, and advancing with a leisurely parody of a human
        stride. It was the first Martian my brother had seen, and he stood, more
        amazed than terrified, watching this Titan advancing deliberately towards
        the shipping, wading farther and farther into the water as the coast fell
        away. Then, far away beyond the Crouch, came another, striding over some
        stunted trees, and then yet another, still farther off, wading deeply through
        a shiny mudflat that seemed to hang halfway up between sea and sky. They
        were all stalking seaward, as if to intercept the escape of the multitudinous
        vessels that were crowded between Foulness and the Naze. In spite of the
        throbbing exertions of the engines of the little paddle-boat, and the pouring
        foam that her wheels flung behind her, she receded with terrifying slowness
        from this ominous advance. Glancing northwestward, my brother saw the large
        crescent of shipping already writhing with the approaching terror; one ship
        passing behind another, another coming round from broadside to end on, steamships
        whistling and giving off volumes of steam, sails being let out, launches
        rushing hither and thither. He was so fascinated by this and by the creeping
        danger away to the left that he had no eyes for anything seaward. And then
        a swift movement of the steamboat (she had suddenly come round to avoid being
        run down) flung him headlong from the seat upon which he was standing. There
        was a shouting all about him, a trampling of feet, and a cheer that seemed
        to be answered faintly. The steamboat lurched and rolled him over upon his
        hands. He sprang to his feet and saw to starboard, and not a hundred yards
        from their heeling, pitching boat, a vast iron bulk like the blade of a plough
        tearing through the water, tossing it on either side in huge waves of foam
        that leaped towards the steamer, flinging her paddles helplessly in the air,
        and then sucking her deck down almost to the waterline. A douche of spray
        blinded my brother for a moment. When his eyes were clear again he saw the
        monster had passed and was rushing landward. Big iron upperworks rose out
        of this headlong structure, and from that twin funnels projected and spat
        a smoking blast shot with fire. It was the torpedo ram, Thunder Child, steaming
        headlong, coming to the rescue of the threatened shipping. Keeping his footing
        on the heaving deck by clutching the bulwarks, my brother looked past this
        charging leviathan at the Martians again, and he saw the three of them now
        close together, and standing so far out to sea that their tripod supports
        were almost entirely submerged. Thus sunken, and seen in remote perspective,
        they appeared far less formidable than the huge iron bulk in whose wake the
        steamer was pitching so helplessly. It would seem they were regarding this
        new antagonist with astonishment. To their intelligence, it may be, the giant
        was even such another as themselves. The Thunder Child fired no gun, but
        simply drove full speed towards them. It was probably her not firing that
        enabled her to get so near the enemy as she did. They did not know what to
        make of her. One shell, and they would have sent her to the bottom forthwith
        with the Heat-Ray. She was steaming at such a pace that in a minute she seemed
        halfway between the steamboat and the Martians\u2014a diminishing black bulk
        against the receding horizontal expanse of the Essex coast. Suddenly the
        foremost Martian lowered his tube and discharged a canister of the black
        gas at the ironclad. It hit her larboard side and glanced off in an inky
        jet that rolled away to seaward, an unfolding torrent of Black Smoke, from
        which the ironclad drove clear. To the watchers from the steamer, low in
        the water and with the sun in their eyes, it seemed as though she were already
        among the Martians. They saw the gaunt figures separating and rising out
        of the water as they retreated shoreward, and one of them raised the camera-like
        generator of the Heat-Ray. He held it pointing obliquely downward, and a
        bank of steam sprang from the water at its touch. It must have driven through
        the iron of the ship\u2019s side like a white-hot iron rod through paper.
        A flicker of flame went up through the rising steam, and then the Martian
        reeled and staggered. In another moment he was cut down, and a great body
        of water and steam shot high in the air. The guns of the Thunder Child sounded
        through the reek, going off one after the other, and one shot splashed the
        water high close by the steamer, ricocheted towards the other flying ships
        to the north, and smashed a smack to matchwood. But no one heeded that very
        much. At the sight of the Martian\u2019s collapse the captain on the bridge
        yelled inarticulately, and all the crowding passengers on the steamer\u2019s
        stern shouted together. And then they yelled again. For, surging out beyond
        the white tumult, drove something long and black, the flames streaming from
        its middle parts, its ventilators and funnels spouting fire. She was alive
        still; the steering gear, it seems, was intact and her engines working. She
        headed straight for a second Martian, and was within a hundred yards of him
        when the Heat-Ray came to bear. Then with a violent thud, a blinding flash,
        her decks, her funnels, leaped upward. The Martian staggered with the violence
        of her explosion, and in another moment the flaming wreckage, still driving
        forward with the impetus of its pace, had struck him and crumpled him up
        like a thing of cardboard. My brother shouted involuntarily. A boiling tumult
        of steam hid everything again. \u201CTwo!\u201D yelled the captain. Everyone
        was shouting. The whole steamer from end to end rang with frantic cheering
        that was taken up first by one and then by all in the crowding multitude
        of ships and boats that was driving out to sea. The steam hung upon the water
        for many minutes, hiding the third Martian and the coast altogether. And
        all this time the boat was paddling steadily out to sea and away from the
        fight; and when at last the confusion cleared, the drifting bank of black
        vapour intervened, and nothing of the Thunder Child could be made out, nor
        could the third Martian be seen. But the ironclads to seaward were now quite
        close and standing in towards shore past the steamboat. The little vessel
        continued to beat its way seaward, and the ironclads receded slowly towards
        the coast, which was hidden still by a marbled bank of vapour, part steam,
        part black gas, eddying and combining in the strangest way. The fleet of
        refugees was scattering to the northeast; several smacks were sailing between
        the ironclads and the steamboat. After a time, and before they reached the
        sinking cloud bank, the warships turned northward, and then abruptly went
        about and passed into the thickening haze of evening southward. The coast
        grew faint, and at last indistinguishable amid the low banks of clouds that
        were gathering about the sinking sun. Then suddenly out of the golden haze
        of the sunset came the vibration of guns, and a form of black shadows moving.
        Everyone struggled to the rail of the steamer and peered into the blinding
        furnace of the west, but nothing was to be distinguished clearly. A mass
        of smoke rose slanting and barred the face of the sun. The steamboat throbbed
        on its way through an interminable suspense. The sun sank into grey clouds,
        the sky flushed and darkened, the evening star trembled into sight. It was
        deep twilight when the captain cried out and pointed. My brother strained
        his eyes. Something rushed up into the sky out of the greyness\u2014rushed
        slantingly upward and very swiftly into the luminous clearness above the
        clouds in the western sky; something flat and broad, and very large, that
        swept round in a vast curve, grew smaller, sank slowly, and vanished again
        into the grey mystery of the night. And as it flew it rained down darkness
        upon the land."
