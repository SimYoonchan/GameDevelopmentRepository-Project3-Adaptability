      value: "About halfway between West Egg and New York the motor road hastily
        joins the railroad and runs beside it for a quarter of a mile, so as to shrink
        away from a certain desolate area of land. This is a valley of ashes\u2014a
        fantastic farm where ashes grow like wheat into ridges and hills and grotesque
        gardens; where ashes take the forms of houses and chimneys and rising smoke
        and, finally, with a transcendent effort, of ash-grey men, who move dimly
        and already crumbling through the powdery air. Occasionally a line of grey
        cars crawls along an invisible track, gives out a ghastly creak, and comes
        to rest, and immediately the ash-grey men swarm up with leaden spades and
        stir up an impenetrable cloud, which screens their obscure operations from
        your sight. But above the grey land and the spasms of bleak dust which drift
        endlessly over it, you perceive, after a moment, the eyes of Doctor T. J.
        Eckleburg. The eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg are blue and gigantic\u2014their
        retinas are one yard high. They look out of no face, but, instead, from a
        pair of enormous yellow spectacles which pass over a nonexistent nose. Evidently
        some wild wag of an oculist set them there to fatten his practice in the
        borough of Queens, and then sank down himself into eternal blindness, or
        forgot them and moved away. But his eyes, dimmed a little by many paintless
        days, under sun and rain, brood on over the solemn dumping ground. The valley
        of ashes is bounded on one side by a small foul river, and, when the drawbridge
        is up to let barges through, the passengers on waiting trains can stare at
        the dismal scene for as long as half an hour. There is always a halt there
        of at least a minute, and it was because of this that I first met Tom Buchanan\u2019s
        mistress. The fact that he had one was insisted upon wherever he was known.
        His acquaintances resented the fact that he turned up in popular caf\xE9s
        with her and, leaving her at a table, sauntered about, chatting with whomsoever
        he knew. Though I was curious to see her, I had no desire to meet her\u2014but
        I did. I went up to New York with Tom on the train one afternoon, and when
        we stopped by the ash-heaps he jumped to his feet and, taking hold of my
        elbow, literally forced me from the car. \u201CWe\u2019re getting off,\u201D
        he insisted. \u201CI want you to meet my girl.\u201D I think he\u2019d tanked
        up a good deal at luncheon, and his determination to have my company bordered
        on violence. The supercilious assumption was that on Sunday afternoon I had
        nothing better to do. I followed him over a low whitewashed railroad fence,
        and we walked back a hundred yards along the road under Doctor Eckleburg\u2019s
        persistent stare. The only building in sight was a small block of yellow
        brick sitting on the edge of the waste land, a sort of compact Main Street
        ministering to it, and contiguous to absolutely nothing. One of the three
        shops it contained was for rent and another was an all-night restaurant,
        approached by a trail of ashes; the third was a garage\u2014Repairs. George
        B. Wilson. Cars bought and sold.\u2014and I followed Tom inside. The interior
        was unprosperous and bare; the only car visible was the dust-covered wreck
        of a Ford which crouched in a dim corner. It had occurred to me that this
        shadow of a garage must be a blind, and that sumptuous and romantic apartments
        were concealed overhead, when the proprietor himself appeared in the door
        of an office, wiping his hands on a piece of waste. He was a blond, spiritless
        man, anaemic, and faintly handsome. When he saw us a damp gleam of hope sprang
        into his light blue eyes. \u201CHello, Wilson, old man,\u201D said Tom, slapping
        him jovially on the shoulder. \u201CHow\u2019s business?\u201D \u201CI can\u2019t
        complain,\u201D answered Wilson unconvincingly. \u201CWhen are you going
        to sell me that car?\u201D \u201CNext week; I\u2019ve got my man working
        on it now.\u201D \u201CWorks pretty slow, don\u2019t he?\u201D \u201CNo,
        he doesn\u2019t,\u201D said Tom coldly. \u201CAnd if you feel that way about
        it, maybe I\u2019d better sell it somewhere else after all.\u201D \u201CI
        don\u2019t mean that,\u201D explained Wilson quickly. \u201CI just meant\u2014\u201D
        His voice faded off and Tom glanced impatiently around the garage. Then I
        heard footsteps on a stairs, and in a moment the thickish figure of a woman
        blocked out the light from the office door. She was in the middle thirties,
        and faintly stout, but she carried her flesh sensuously as some women can.
        Her face, above a spotted dress of dark blue cr\xEApe-de-chine, contained
        no facet or gleam of beauty, but there was an immediately perceptible vitality
        about her as if the nerves of her body were continually smouldering. She
        smiled slowly and, walking through her husband as if he were a ghost, shook
        hands with Tom, looking him flush in the eye. Then she wet her lips, and
        without turning around spoke to her husband in a soft, coarse voice: \u201CGet
        some chairs, why don\u2019t you, so somebody can sit down.\u201D \u201COh,
        sure,\u201D agreed Wilson hurriedly, and went toward the little office, mingling
        immediately with the cement colour of the walls. A white ashen dust veiled
        his dark suit and his pale hair as it veiled everything in the vicinity\u2014except
        his wife, who moved close to Tom. \u201CI want to see you,\u201D said Tom
        intently. \u201CGet on the next train.\u201D \u201CAll right.\u201D \u201CI\u2019ll
        meet you by the newsstand on the lower level.\u201D She nodded and moved
        away from him just as George Wilson emerged with two chairs from his office
        door. We waited for her down the road and out of sight. It was a few days
        before the Fourth of July, and a grey, scrawny Italian child was setting
        torpedoes in a row along the railroad track. \u201CTerrible place, isn\u2019t
        it,\u201D said Tom, exchanging a frown with Doctor Eckleburg. \u201CAwful.\u201D
        \u201CIt does her good to get away.\u201D \u201CDoesn\u2019t her husband
        object?\u201D \u201CWilson? He thinks she goes to see her sister in New York.
        He\u2019s so dumb he doesn\u2019t know he\u2019s alive.\u201D So Tom Buchanan
        and his girl and I went up together to New York\u2014or not quite together,
        for Mrs. Wilson sat discreetly in another car. Tom deferred that much to
        the sensibilities of those East Eggers who might be on the train. She had
        changed her dress to a brown figured muslin, which stretched tight over her
        rather wide hips as Tom helped her to the platform in New York. At the newsstand
        she bought a copy of Town Tattle and a moving-picture magazine, and in the
        station drugstore some cold cream and a small flask of perfume. Upstairs,
        in the solemn echoing drive she let four taxicabs drive away before she selected
        a new one, lavender-coloured with grey upholstery, and in this we slid out
        from the mass of the station into the glowing sunshine. But immediately she
        turned sharply from the window and, leaning forward, tapped on the front
        glass. \u201CI want to get one of those dogs,\u201D she said earnestly. \u201CI
        want to get one for the apartment. They\u2019re nice to have\u2014a dog.\u201D
        We backed up to a grey old man who bore an absurd resemblance to John D.
        Rockefeller. In a basket swung from his neck cowered a dozen very recent
        puppies of an indeterminate breed. \u201CWhat kind are they?\u201D asked
        Mrs. Wilson eagerly, as he came to the taxi-window. \u201CAll kinds. What
        kind do you want, lady?\u201D \u201CI\u2019d like to get one of those police
        dogs; I don\u2019t suppose you got that kind?\u201D The man peered doubtfully
        into the basket, plunged in his hand and drew one up, wriggling, by the back
        of the neck. \u201CThat\u2019s no police dog,\u201D said Tom. \u201CNo, it\u2019s
        not exactly a police dog,\u201D said the man with disappointment in his voice.
        \u201CIt\u2019s more of an Airedale.\u201D He passed his hand over the brown
        washrag of a back. \u201CLook at that coat. Some coat. That\u2019s a dog
        that\u2019ll never bother you with catching cold.\u201D \u201CI think it\u2019s
        cute,\u201D said Mrs. Wilson enthusiastically. \u201CHow much is it?\u201D
        \u201CThat dog?\u201D He looked at it admiringly. \u201CThat dog will cost
        you ten dollars.\u201D The Airedale\u2014undoubtedly there was an Airedale
        concerned in it somewhere, though its feet were startlingly white\u2014changed
        hands and settled down into Mrs. Wilson\u2019s lap, where she fondled the
        weatherproof coat with rapture. \u201CIs it a boy or a girl?\u201D she asked
        delicately. \u201CThat dog? That dog\u2019s a boy.\u201D \u201CIt\u2019s
        a bitch,\u201D said Tom decisively. \u201CHere\u2019s your money. Go and
        buy ten more dogs with it.\u201D We drove over to Fifth Avenue, warm and
        soft, almost pastoral, on the summer Sunday afternoon. I wouldn\u2019t have
        been surprised to see a great flock of white sheep turn the corner. \u201CHold
        on,\u201D I said, \u201CI have to leave you here.\u201D \u201CNo you don\u2019t,\u201D
        interposed Tom quickly. \u201CMyrtle\u2019ll be hurt if you don\u2019t come
        up to the apartment. Won\u2019t you, Myrtle?\u201D \u201CCome on,\u201D she
        urged. \u201CI\u2019ll telephone my sister Catherine. She\u2019s said to
        be very beautiful by people who ought to know.\u201D \u201CWell, I\u2019d
        like to, but\u2014\u201D We went on, cutting back again over the Park toward
        the West Hundreds. At 158th Street the cab stopped at one slice in a long
        white cake of apartment-houses. Throwing a regal homecoming glance around
        the neighbourhood, Mrs. Wilson gathered up her dog and her other purchases,
        and went haughtily in. \u201CI\u2019m going to have the McKees come up,\u201D
        she announced as we rose in the elevator. \u201CAnd, of course, I got to
        call up my sister, too.\u201D The apartment was on the top floor\u2014a small
        living-room, a small dining-room, a small bedroom, and a bath. The living-room
        was crowded to the doors with a set of tapestried furniture entirely too
        large for it, so that to move about was to stumble continually over scenes
        of ladies swinging in the gardens of Versailles. The only picture was an
        over-enlarged photograph, apparently a hen sitting on a blurred rock. Looked
        at from a distance, however, the hen resolved itself into a bonnet, and the
        countenance of a stout old lady beamed down into the room. Several old copies
        of Town Tattle lay on the table together with a copy of Simon Called Peter,
        and some of the small scandal magazines of Broadway. Mrs. Wilson was first
        concerned with the dog. A reluctant elevator boy went for a box full of straw
        and some milk, to which he added on his own initiative a tin of large, hard
        dog biscuits\u2014one of which decomposed apathetically in the saucer of
        milk all afternoon. Meanwhile Tom brought out a bottle of whisky from a locked
        bureau door. I have been drunk just twice in my life, and the second time
        was that afternoon; so everything that happened has a dim, hazy cast over
        it, although until after eight o\u2019clock the apartment was full of cheerful
        sun. Sitting on Tom\u2019s lap Mrs. Wilson called up several people on the
        telephone; then there were no cigarettes, and I went out to buy some at the
        drugstore on the corner. When I came back they had both disappeared, so I
        sat down discreetly in the living-room and read a chapter of Simon Called
        Peter\u2014either it was terrible stuff or the whisky distorted things, because
        it didn\u2019t make any sense to me. Just as Tom and Myrtle (after the first
        drink Mrs. Wilson and I called each other by our first names) reappeared,
        company commenced to arrive at the apartment door. The sister, Catherine,
        was a slender, worldly girl of about thirty, with a solid, sticky bob of
        red hair, and a complexion powdered milky white. Her eyebrows had been plucked
        and then drawn on again at a more rakish angle, but the efforts of nature
        toward the restoration of the old alignment gave a blurred air to her face.
        When she moved about there was an incessant clicking as innumerable pottery
        bracelets jingled up and down upon her arms. She came in with such a proprietary
        haste, and looked around so possessively at the furniture that I wondered
        if she lived here. But when I asked her she laughed immoderately, repeated
        my question aloud, and told me she lived with a girl friend at a hotel. Mr.
        McKee was a pale, feminine man from the flat below. He had just shaved, for
        there was a white spot of lather on his cheekbone, and he was most respectful
        in his greeting to everyone in the room. He informed me that he was in the
        \u201Cartistic game,\u201D and I gathered later that he was a photographer
        and had made the dim enlargement of Mrs. Wilson\u2019s mother which hovered
        like an ectoplasm on the wall. His wife was shrill, languid, handsome, and
        horrible. She told me with pride that her husband had photographed her a
        hundred and twenty-seven times since they had been married. Mrs. Wilson had
        changed her costume some time before, and was now attired in an elaborate
        afternoon dress of cream-coloured chiffon, which gave out a continual rustle
        as she swept about the room. With the influence of the dress her personality
        had also undergone a change. The intense vitality that had been so remarkable
        in the garage was converted into impressive hauteur. Her laughter, her gestures,
        her assertions became more violently affected moment by moment, and as she
        expanded the room grew smaller around her, until she seemed to be revolving
        on a noisy, creaking pivot through the smoky air. \u201CMy dear,\u201D she
        told her sister in a high, mincing shout, \u201Cmost of these fellas will
        cheat you every time. All they think of is money. I had a woman up here last
        week to look at my feet, and when she gave me the bill you\u2019d of thought
        she had my appendicitis out.\u201D \u201CWhat was the name of the woman?\u201D
        asked Mrs. McKee. \u201CMrs. Eberhardt. She goes around looking at people\u2019s
        feet in their own homes.\u201D \u201CI like your dress,\u201D remarked Mrs.
        McKee, \u201CI think it\u2019s adorable.\u201D Mrs. Wilson rejected the compliment
        by raising her eyebrow in disdain. \u201CIt\u2019s just a crazy old thing,\u201D
        she said. \u201CI just slip it on sometimes when I don\u2019t care what I
        look like.\u201D \u201CBut it looks wonderful on you, if you know what I
        mean,\u201D pursued Mrs. McKee. \u201CIf Chester could only get you in that
        pose I think he could make something of it.\u201D We all looked in silence
        at Mrs. Wilson, who removed a strand of hair from over her eyes and looked
        back at us with a brilliant smile. Mr. McKee regarded her intently with his
        head on one side, and then moved his hand back and forth slowly in front
        of his face. \u201CI should change the light,\u201D he said after a moment.
        \u201CI\u2019d like to bring out the modelling of the features. And I\u2019d
        try to get hold of all the back hair.\u201D \u201CI wouldn\u2019t think of
        changing the light,\u201D cried Mrs. McKee. \u201CI think it\u2019s\u2014\u201D
        Her husband said \u201CSh!\u201D and we all looked at the subject again,
        whereupon Tom Buchanan yawned audibly and got to his feet. \u201CYou McKees
        have something to drink,\u201D he said. \u201CGet some more ice and mineral
        water, Myrtle, before everybody goes to sleep.\u201D \u201CI told that boy
        about the ice.\u201D Myrtle raised her eyebrows in despair at the shiftlessness
        of the lower orders. \u201CThese people! You have to keep after them all
        the time.\u201D She looked at me and laughed pointlessly. Then she flounced
        over to the dog, kissed it with ecstasy, and swept into the kitchen, implying
        that a dozen chefs awaited her orders there. \u201CI\u2019ve done some nice
        things out on Long Island,\u201D asserted Mr. McKee. Tom looked at him blankly.
        \u201CTwo of them we have framed downstairs.\u201D \u201CTwo what?\u201D
        demanded Tom. \u201CTwo studies. One of them I call Montauk Point\u2014The
        Gulls, and the other I call Montauk Point\u2014The Sea.\u201D The sister
        Catherine sat down beside me on the couch. \u201CDo you live down on Long
        Island, too?\u201D she inquired. \u201CI live at West Egg.\u201D \u201CReally?
        I was down there at a party about a month ago. At a man named Gatsby\u2019s.
        Do you know him?\u201D \u201CI live next door to him.\u201D \u201CWell, they
        say he\u2019s a nephew or a cousin of Kaiser Wilhelm\u2019s. That\u2019s
        where all his money comes from.\u201D \u201CReally?\u201D She nodded. \u201CI\u2019m
        scared of him. I\u2019d hate to have him get anything on me.\u201D This absorbing
        information about my neighbour was interrupted by Mrs. McKee\u2019s pointing
        suddenly at Catherine: \u201CChester, I think you could do something with
        her,\u201D she broke out, but Mr. McKee only nodded in a bored way, and turned
        his attention to Tom. \u201CI\u2019d like to do more work on Long Island,
        if I could get the entry. All I ask is that they should give me a start.\u201D
        \u201CAsk Myrtle,\u201D said Tom, breaking into a short shout of laughter
        as Mrs. Wilson entered with a tray. \u201CShe\u2019ll give you a letter of
        introduction, won\u2019t you, Myrtle?\u201D \u201CDo what?\u201D she asked,
        startled. \u201CYou\u2019ll give McKee a letter of introduction to your husband,
        so he can do some studies of him.\u201D His lips moved silently for a moment
        as he invented, \u201C\u200A\u2018George B. Wilson at the Gasoline Pump,\u2019
        or something like that.\u201D Catherine leaned close to me and whispered
        in my ear: \u201CNeither of them can stand the person they\u2019re married
        to.\u201D \u201CCan\u2019t they?\u201D \u201CCan\u2019t stand them.\u201D
        She looked at Myrtle and then at Tom. \u201CWhat I say is, why go on living
        with them if they can\u2019t stand them? If I was them I\u2019d get a divorce
        and get married to each other right away.\u201D \u201CDoesn\u2019t she like
        Wilson either?\u201D The answer to this was unexpected. It came from Myrtle,
        who had overheard the question, and it was violent and obscene. \u201CYou
        see,\u201D cried Catherine triumphantly. She lowered her voice again. \u201CIt\u2019s
        really his wife that\u2019s keeping them apart. She\u2019s a Catholic, and
        they don\u2019t believe in divorce.\u201D Daisy was not a Catholic, and I
        was a little shocked at the elaborateness of the lie. \u201CWhen they do
        get married,\u201D continued Catherine, \u201Cthey\u2019re going West to
        live for a while until it blows over.\u201D \u201CIt\u2019d be more discreet
        to go to Europe.\u201D \u201COh, do you like Europe?\u201D she exclaimed
        surprisingly. \u201CI just got back from Monte Carlo.\u201D \u201CReally.\u201D
        \u201CJust last year. I went over there with another girl.\u201D \u201CStay
        long?\u201D \u201CNo, we just went to Monte Carlo and back. We went by way
        of Marseilles. We had over twelve hundred dollars when we started, but we
        got gyped out of it all in two days in the private rooms. We had an awful
        time getting back, I can tell you. God, how I hated that town!\u201D The
        late afternoon sky bloomed in the window for a moment like the blue honey
        of the Mediterranean\u2014then the shrill voice of Mrs. McKee called me back
        into the room. \u201CI almost made a mistake, too,\u201D she declared vigorously.
        \u201CI almost married a little kike who\u2019d been after me for years.
        I knew he was below me. Everybody kept saying to me: \u2018Lucille, that
        man\u2019s way below you!\u2019 But if I hadn\u2019t met Chester, he\u2019d
        of got me sure.\u201D \u201CYes, but listen,\u201D said Myrtle Wilson, nodding
        her head up and down, \u201Cat least you didn\u2019t marry him.\u201D \u201CI
        know I didn\u2019t.\u201D \u201CWell, I married him,\u201D said Myrtle, ambiguously.
        \u201CAnd that\u2019s the difference between your case and mine.\u201D \u201CWhy
        did you, Myrtle?\u201D demanded Catherine. \u201CNobody forced you to.\u201D
        Myrtle considered. \u201CI married him because I thought he was a gentleman,\u201D
        she said finally. \u201CI thought he knew something about breeding, but he
        wasn\u2019t fit to lick my shoe.\u201D \u201CYou were crazy about him for
        a while,\u201D said Catherine. \u201CCrazy about him!\u201D cried Myrtle
        incredulously. \u201CWho said I was crazy about him? I never was any more
        crazy about him than I was about that man there.\u201D She pointed suddenly
        at me, and everyone looked at me accusingly. I tried to show by my expression
        that I expected no affection. \u201CThe only crazy I was was when I married
        him. I knew right away I made a mistake. He borrowed somebody\u2019s best
        suit to get married in, and never even told me about it, and the man came
        after it one day when he was out: \u2018Oh, is that your suit?\u2019 I said.
        \u2018This is the first I ever heard about it.\u2019 But I gave it to him
        and then I lay down and cried to beat the band all afternoon.\u201D \u201CShe
        really ought to get away from him,\u201D resumed Catherine to me. \u201CThey\u2019ve
        been living over that garage for eleven years. And Tom\u2019s the first sweetie
        she ever had.\u201D The bottle of whisky\u2014a second one\u2014was now in
        constant demand by all present, excepting Catherine, who \u201Cfelt just
        as good on nothing at all.\u201D Tom rang for the janitor and sent him for
        some celebrated sandwiches, which were a complete supper in themselves. I
        wanted to get out and walk eastward toward the park through the soft twilight,
        but each time I tried to go I became entangled in some wild, strident argument
        which pulled me back, as if with ropes, into my chair. Yet high over the
        city our line of yellow windows must have contributed their share of human
        secrecy to the casual watcher in the darkening streets, and I saw him too,
        looking up and wondering. I was within and without, simultaneously enchanted
        and repelled by the inexhaustible variety of life. Myrtle pulled her chair
        close to mine, and suddenly her warm breath poured over me the story of her
        first meeting with Tom. \u201CIt was on the two little seats facing each
        other that are always the last ones left on the train. I was going up to
        New York to see my sister and spend the night. He had on a dress suit and
        patent leather shoes, and I couldn\u2019t keep my eyes off him, but every
        time he looked at me I had to pretend to be looking at the advertisement
        over his head. When we came into the station he was next to me, and his white
        shirtfront pressed against my arm, and so I told him I\u2019d have to call
        a policeman, but he knew I lied. I was so excited that when I got into a
        taxi with him I didn\u2019t hardly know I wasn\u2019t getting into a subway
        train. All I kept thinking about, over and over, was \u2018You can\u2019t
        live forever; you can\u2019t live forever.\u2019\u200A\u201D She turned to
        Mrs. McKee and the room rang full of her artificial laughter. \u201CMy dear,\u201D
        she cried, \u201CI\u2019m going to give you this dress as soon as I\u2019m
        through with it. I\u2019ve got to get another one tomorrow. I\u2019m going
        to make a list of all the things I\u2019ve got to get. A massage and a wave,
        and a collar for the dog, and one of those cute little ashtrays where you
        touch a spring, and a wreath with a black silk bow for mother\u2019s grave
        that\u2019ll last all summer. I got to write down a list so I won\u2019t
        forget all the things I got to do.\u201D It was nine o\u2019clock\u2014almost
        immediately afterward I looked at my watch and found it was ten. Mr. McKee
        was asleep on a chair with his fists clenched in his lap, like a photograph
        of a man of action. Taking out my handkerchief I wiped from his cheek the
        spot of dried lather that had worried me all the afternoon. The little dog
        was sitting on the table looking with blind eyes through the smoke, and from
        time to time groaning faintly. People disappeared, reappeared, made plans
        to go somewhere, and then lost each other, searched for each other, found
        each other a few feet away. Some time toward midnight Tom Buchanan and Mrs.
        Wilson stood face to face discussing, in impassioned voices, whether Mrs.
        Wilson had any right to mention Daisy\u2019s name. \u201CDaisy! Daisy! Daisy!\u201D
        shouted Mrs. Wilson. \u201CI\u2019ll say it whenever I want to! Daisy! Dai\u2014\u201D
        Making a short deft movement, Tom Buchanan broke her nose with his open hand.
        Then there were bloody towels upon the bathroom floor, and women\u2019s voices
        scolding, and high over the confusion a long broken wail of pain. Mr. McKee
        awoke from his doze and started in a daze toward the door. When he had gone
        halfway he turned around and stared at the scene\u2014his wife and Catherine
        scolding and consoling as they stumbled here and there among the crowded
        furniture with articles of aid, and the despairing figure on the couch, bleeding
        fluently, and trying to spread a copy of Town Tattle over the tapestry scenes
        of Versailles. Then Mr. McKee turned and continued on out the door. Taking
        my hat from the chandelier, I followed. \u201CCome to lunch some day,\u201D
        he suggested, as we groaned down in the elevator. \u201CWhere?\u201D \u201CAnywhere.\u201D
        \u201CKeep your hands off the lever,\u201D snapped the elevator boy. \u201CI
        beg your pardon,\u201D said Mr. McKee with dignity, \u201CI didn\u2019t know
        I was touching it.\u201D \u201CAll right,\u201D I agreed, \u201CI\u2019ll
        be glad to.\u201D \u2026 I was standing beside his bed and he was sitting
        up between the sheets, clad in his underwear, with a great portfolio in his
        hands. \u201CBeauty and the Beast\u2026 Loneliness\u2026 Old Grocery Horse\u2026
        Brook\u2019n Bridge\u2026\u201D Then I was lying half asleep in the cold
        lower level of the Pennsylvania Station, staring at the morning Tribune,
        and waiting for the four o\u2019clock train. "
