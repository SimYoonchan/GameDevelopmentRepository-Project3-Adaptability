      value: "It was while the curate had sat and talked so wildly to me under the
        hedge in the flat meadows near Halliford, and while my brother was watching
        the fugitives stream over Westminster Bridge, that the Martians had resumed
        the offensive. So far as one can ascertain from the conflicting accounts
        that have been put forth, the majority of them remained busied with preparations
        in the Horsell pit until nine that night, hurrying on some operation that
        disengaged huge volumes of green smoke. But three certainly came out about
        eight o\u2019clock and, advancing slowly and cautiously, made their way through
        Byfleet and Pyrford towards Ripley and Weybridge, and so came in sight of
        the expectant batteries against the setting sun. These Martians did not advance
        in a body, but in a line, each perhaps a mile and a half from his nearest
        fellow. They communicated with one another by means of sirenlike howls, running
        up and down the scale from one note to another. It was this howling and firing
        of the guns at Ripley and St. George\u2019s Hill that we had heard at Upper
        Halliford. The Ripley gunners, unseasoned artillery volunteers who ought
        never to have been placed in such a position, fired one wild, premature,
        ineffectual volley, and bolted on horse and foot through the deserted village,
        while the Martian, without using his Heat-Ray, walked serenely over their
        guns, stepped gingerly among them, passed in front of them, and so came unexpectedly
        upon the guns in Painshill Park, which he destroyed. The St. George\u2019s
        Hill men, however, were better led or of a better mettle. Hidden by a pine
        wood as they were, they seem to have been quite unsuspected by the Martian
        nearest to them. They laid their guns as deliberately as if they had been
        on parade, and fired at about a thousand yards\u2019 range. The shells flashed
        all round him, and he was seen to advance a few paces, stagger, and go down.
        Everybody yelled together, and the guns were reloaded in frantic haste. The
        overthrown Martian set up a prolonged ululation, and immediately a second
        glittering giant, answering him, appeared over the trees to the south. It
        would seem that a leg of the tripod had been smashed by one of the shells.
        The whole of the second volley flew wide of the Martian on the ground, and,
        simultaneously, both his companions brought their Heat-Rays to bear on the
        battery. The ammunition blew up, the pine trees all about the guns flashed
        into fire, and only one or two of the men who were already running over the
        crest of the hill escaped. After this it would seem that the three took counsel
        together and halted, and the scouts who were watching them report that they
        remained absolutely stationary for the next half hour. The Martian who had
        been overthrown crawled tediously out of his hood, a small brown figure,
        oddly suggestive from that distance of a speck of blight, and apparently
        engaged in the repair of his support. About nine he had finished, for his
        cowl was then seen above the trees again. It was a few minutes past nine
        that night when these three sentinels were joined by four other Martians,
        each carrying a thick black tube. A similar tube was handed to each of the
        three, and the seven proceeded to distribute themselves at equal distances
        along a curved line between St. George\u2019s Hill, Weybridge, and the village
        of Send, southwest of Ripley. A dozen rockets sprang out of the hills before
        them so soon as they began to move, and warned the waiting batteries about
        Ditton and Esher. At the same time four of their fighting machines, similarly
        armed with tubes, crossed the river, and two of them, black against the western
        sky, came into sight of myself and the curate as we hurried wearily and painfully
        along the road that runs northward out of Halliford. They moved, as it seemed
        to us, upon a cloud, for a milky mist covered the fields and rose to a third
        of their height. At this sight the curate cried faintly in his throat, and
        began running; but I knew it was no good running from a Martian, and I turned
        aside and crawled through dewy nettles and brambles into the broad ditch
        by the side of the road. He looked back, saw what I was doing, and turned
        to join me. The two halted, the nearer to us standing and facing Sunbury,
        the remoter being a grey indistinctness towards the evening star, away towards
        Staines. The occasional howling of the Martians had ceased; they took up
        their positions in the huge crescent about their cylinders in absolute silence.
        It was a crescent with twelve miles between its horns. Never since the devising
        of gunpowder was the beginning of a battle so still. To us and to an observer
        about Ripley it would have had precisely the same effect\u2014the Martians
        seemed in solitary possession of the darkling night, lit only as it was by
        the slender moon, the stars, the afterglow of the daylight, and the ruddy
        glare from St. George\u2019s Hill and the woods of Painshill. But facing
        that crescent everywhere\u2014at Staines, Hounslow, Ditton, Esher, Ockham,
        behind hills and woods south of the river, and across the flat grass meadows
        to the north of it, wherever a cluster of trees or village houses gave sufficient
        cover\u2014the guns were waiting. The signal rockets burst and rained their
        sparks through the night and vanished, and the spirit of all those watching
        batteries rose to a tense expectation. The Martians had but to advance into
        the line of fire, and instantly those motionless black forms of men, those
        guns glittering so darkly in the early night, would explode into a thunderous
        fury of battle. No doubt the thought that was uppermost in a thousand of
        those vigilant minds, even as it was uppermost in mine, was the riddle\u2014how
        much they understood of us. Did they grasp that we in our millions were organized,
        disciplined, working together? Or did they interpret our spurts of fire,
        the sudden stinging of our shells, our steady investment of their encampment,
        as we should the furious unanimity of onslaught in a disturbed hive of bees?
        Did they dream they might exterminate us? (At that time no one knew what
        food they needed.) A hundred such questions struggled together in my mind
        as I watched that vast sentinel shape. And in the back of my mind was the
        sense of all the huge unknown and hidden forces Londonward. Had they prepared
        pitfalls? Were the powder mills at Hounslow ready as a snare? Would the Londoners
        have the heart and courage to make a greater Moscow of their mighty province
        of houses? Then, after an interminable time, as it seemed to us, crouching
        and peering through the hedge, came a sound like the distant concussion of
        a gun. Another nearer, and then another. And then the Martian beside us raised
        his tube on high and discharged it, gunwise, with a heavy report that made
        the ground heave. The one towards Staines answered him. There was no flash,
        no smoke, simply that loaded detonation. I was so excited by these heavy
        minute-guns following one another that I so far forgot my personal safety
        and my scalded hands as to clamber up into the hedge and stare towards Sunbury.
        As I did so a second report followed, and a big projectile hurtled overhead
        towards Hounslow. I expected at least to see smoke or fire, or some such
        evidence of its work. But all I saw was the deep blue sky above, with one
        solitary star, and the white mist spreading wide and low beneath. And there
        had been no crash, no answering explosion. The silence was restored; the
        minute lengthened to three. \u201CWhat has happened?\u201D said the curate,
        standing up beside me. \u201CHeaven knows!\u201D said I. A bat flickered
        by and vanished. A distant tumult of shouting began and ceased. I looked
        again at the Martian, and saw he was now moving eastward along the riverbank,
        with a swift, rolling motion. Every moment I expected the fire of some hidden
        battery to spring upon him; but the evening calm was unbroken. The figure
        of the Martian grew smaller as he receded, and presently the mist and the
        gathering night had swallowed him up. By a common impulse we clambered higher.
        Towards Sunbury was a dark appearance, as though a conical hill had suddenly
        come into being there, hiding our view of the farther country; and then,
        remoter across the river, over Walton, we saw another such summit. These
        hill-like forms grew lower and broader even as we stared. Moved by a sudden
        thought, I looked northward, and there I perceived a third of these cloudy
        black kopjes had risen. Everything had suddenly become very still. Far away
        to the southeast, marking the quiet, we heard the Martians hooting to one
        another, and then the air quivered again with the distant thud of their guns.
        But the earthly artillery made no reply. Now at the time we could not understand
        these things, but later I was to learn the meaning of these ominous kopjes
        that gathered in the twilight. Each of the Martians, standing in the great
        crescent I have described, had discharged, by means of the gunlike tube he
        carried, a huge canister over whatever hill, copse, cluster of houses, or
        other possible cover for guns, chanced to be in front of him. Some fired
        only one of these, some two\u2014as in the case of the one we had seen; the
        one at Ripley is said to have discharged no fewer than five at that time.
        These canisters smashed on striking the ground\u2014they did not explode\u2014and
        incontinently disengaged an enormous volume of heavy, inky vapour, coiling
        and pouring upward in a huge and ebony cumulus cloud, a gaseous hill that
        sank and spread itself slowly over the surrounding country. And the touch
        of that vapour, the inhaling of its pungent wisps, was death to all that
        breathes. It was heavy, this vapour, heavier than the densest smoke, so that,
        after the first tumultuous uprush and outflow of its impact, it sank down
        through the air and poured over the ground in a manner rather liquid than
        gaseous, abandoning the hills, and streaming into the valleys and ditches
        and watercourses even as I have heard the carbonic-acid gas that pours from
        volcanic clefts is wont to do. And where it came upon water some chemical
        action occurred, and the surface would be instantly covered with a powdery
        scum that sank slowly and made way for more. The scum was absolutely insoluble,
        and it is a strange thing, seeing the instant effect of the gas, that one
        could drink without hurt the water from which it had been strained. The vapour
        did not diffuse as a true gas would do. It hung together in banks, flowing
        sluggishly down the slope of the land and driving reluctantly before the
        wind, and very slowly it combined with the mist and moisture of the air,
        and sank to the earth in the form of dust. Save that an unknown element giving
        a group of four lines in the blue of the spectrum is concerned, we are still
        entirely ignorant of the nature of this substance. Once the tumultuous upheaval
        of its dispersion was over, the black smoke clung so closely to the ground,
        even before its precipitation, that fifty feet up in the air, on the roofs
        and upper stories of high houses and on great trees, there was a chance of
        escaping its poison altogether, as was proved even that night at Street Cobham
        and Ditton. The man who escaped at the former place tells a wonderful story
        of the strangeness of its coiling flow, and how he looked down from the church
        spire and saw the houses of the village rising like ghosts out of its inky
        nothingness. For a day and a half he remained there, weary, starving and
        sun-scorched, the earth under the blue sky and against the prospect of the
        distant hills a velvet-black expanse, with red roofs, green trees, and, later,
        black-veiled shrubs and gates, barns, outhouses, and walls, rising here and
        there into the sunlight. But that was at Street Cobham, where the black vapour
        was allowed to remain until it sank of its own accord into the ground. As
        a rule the Martians, when it had served its purpose, cleared the air of it
        again by wading into it and directing a jet of steam upon it. This they did
        with the vapour banks near us, as we saw in the starlight from the window
        of a deserted house at Upper Halliford, whither we had returned. From there
        we could see the searchlights on Richmond Hill and Kingston Hill going to
        and fro, and about eleven the windows rattled, and we heard the sound of
        the huge siege guns that had been put in position there. These continued
        intermittently for the space of a quarter of an hour, sending chance shots
        at the invisible Martians at Hampton and Ditton, and then the pale beams
        of the electric light vanished, and were replaced by a bright red glow. Then
        the fourth cylinder fell\u2014a brilliant green meteor\u2014as I learned
        afterwards, in Bushey Park. Before the guns on the Richmond and Kingston
        line of hills began, there was a fitful cannonade far away in the southwest,
        due, I believe, to guns being fired haphazard before the black vapour could
        overwhelm the gunners. So, setting about it as methodically as men might
        smoke out a wasps\u2019 nest, the Martians spread this strange stifling vapour
        over the Londonward country. The horns of the crescent slowly moved apart,
        until at last they formed a line from Hanwell to Coombe and Malden. All night
        through their destructive tubes advanced. Never once, after the Martian at
        St. George\u2019s Hill was brought down, did they give the artillery the
        ghost of a chance against them. Wherever there was a possibility of guns
        being laid for them unseen, a fresh canister of the black vapour was discharged,
        and where the guns were openly displayed the Heat-Ray was brought to bear.
        By midnight the blazing trees along the slopes of Richmond Park and the glare
        of Kingston Hill threw their light upon a network of black smoke, blotting
        out the whole valley of the Thames and extending as far as the eye could
        reach. And through this two Martians slowly waded, and turned their hissing
        steam jets this way and that. They were sparing of the Heat-Ray that night,
        either because they had but a limited supply of material for its production
        or because they did not wish to destroy the country but only to crush and
        overawe the opposition they had aroused. In the latter aim they certainly
        succeeded. Sunday night was the end of the organised opposition to their
        movements. After that no body of men would stand against them, so hopeless
        was the enterprise. Even the crews of the torpedo-boats and destroyers that
        had brought their quick-firers up the Thames refused to stop, mutinied, and
        went down again. The only offensive operation men ventured upon after that
        night was the preparation of mines and pitfalls, and even in that their energies
        were frantic and spasmodic. One has to imagine, as well as one may, the fate
        of those batteries towards Esher, waiting so tensely in the twilight. Survivors
        there were none. One may picture the orderly expectation, the officers alert
        and watchful, the gunners ready, the ammunition piled to hand, the limber
        gunners with their horses and waggons, the groups of civilian spectators
        standing as near as they were permitted, the evening stillness, the ambulances
        and hospital tents with the burned and wounded from Weybridge; then the dull
        resonance of the shots the Martians fired, and the clumsy projectile whirling
        over the trees and houses and smashing amid the neighbouring fields. One
        may picture, too, the sudden shifting of the attention, the swiftly spreading
        coils and bellyings of that blackness advancing headlong, towering heavenward,
        turning the twilight to a palpable darkness, a strange and horrible antagonist
        of vapour striding upon its victims, men and horses near it seen dimly, running,
        shrieking, falling headlong, shouts of dismay, the guns suddenly abandoned,
        men choking and writhing on the ground, and the swift broadening-out of the
        opaque cone of smoke. And then night and extinction\u2014nothing but a silent
        mass of impenetrable vapour hiding its dead. Before dawn the black vapour
        was pouring through the streets of Richmond, and the disintegrating organism
        of government was, with a last expiring effort, rousing the population of
        London to the necessity of flight."
