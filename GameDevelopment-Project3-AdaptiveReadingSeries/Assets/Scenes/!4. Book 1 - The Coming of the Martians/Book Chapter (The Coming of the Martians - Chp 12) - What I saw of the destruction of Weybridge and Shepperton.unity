      value: "As the dawn grew brighter we withdrew from the window from which we
        had watched the Martians, and went very quietly downstairs. The artilleryman
        agreed with me that the house was no place to stay in. He proposed, he said,
        to make his way Londonward, and thence rejoin his battery\u2014No. 12, of
        the Horse Artillery. My plan was to return at once to Leatherhead; and so
        greatly had the strength of the Martians impressed me that I had determined
        to take my wife to Newhaven, and go with her out of the country forthwith.
        For I already perceived clearly that the country about London must inevitably
        be the scene of a disastrous struggle before such creatures as these could
        be destroyed. Between us and Leatherhead, however, lay the third cylinder,
        with its guarding giants. Had I been alone, I think I should have taken my
        chance and struck across country. But the artilleryman dissuaded me: \u201CIt\u2019s
        no kindness to the right sort of wife,\u201D he said, \u201Cto make her a
        widow\u201D; and in the end I agreed to go with him, under cover of the woods,
        northward as far as Street Cobham before I parted with him. Thence I would
        make a big detour by Epsom to reach Leatherhead. I should have started at
        once, but my companion had been in active service and he knew better than
        that. He made me ransack the house for a flask, which he filled with whisky;
        and we lined every available pocket with packets of biscuits and slices of
        meat. Then we crept out of the house, and ran as quickly as we could down
        the ill-made road by which I had come overnight. The houses seemed deserted.
        In the road lay a group of three charred bodies close together, struck dead
        by the Heat-Ray; and here and there were things that people had dropped\u2014a
        clock, a slipper, a silver spoon, and the like poor valuables. At the corner
        turning up towards the post office a little cart, filled with boxes and furniture,
        and horseless, heeled over on a broken wheel. A cash box had been hastily
        smashed open and thrown under the debris. Except the lodge at the Orphanage,
        which was still on fire, none of the houses had suffered very greatly here.
        The Heat-Ray had shaved the chimney tops and passed. Yet, save ourselves,
        there did not seem to be a living soul on Maybury Hill. The majority of the
        inhabitants had escaped, I suppose, by way of the Old Woking road\u2014the
        road I had taken when I drove to Leatherhead\u2014or they had hidden. We
        went down the lane, by the body of the man in black, sodden now from the
        overnight hail, and broke into the woods at the foot of the hill. We pushed
        through these towards the railway without meeting a soul. The woods across
        the line were but the scarred and blackened ruins of woods; for the most
        part the trees had fallen, but a certain proportion still stood, dismal grey
        stems, with dark brown foliage instead of green. On our side the fire had
        done no more than scorch the nearer trees; it had failed to secure its footing.
        In one place the woodmen had been at work on Saturday; trees, felled and
        freshly trimmed, lay in a clearing, with heaps of sawdust by the sawing-machine
        and its engine. Hard by was a temporary hut, deserted. There was not a breath
        of wind this morning, and everything was strangely still. Even the birds
        were hushed, and as we hurried along I and the artilleryman talked in whispers
        and looked now and again over our shoulders. Once or twice we stopped to
        listen. After a time we drew near the road, and as we did so we heard the
        clatter of hoofs and saw through the tree stems three cavalry soldiers riding
        slowly towards Woking. We hailed them, and they halted while we hurried towards
        them. It was a lieutenant and a couple of privates of the 8th Hussars, with
        a stand like a theodolite, which the artilleryman told me was a heliograph.
        \u201CYou are the first men I\u2019ve seen coming this way this morning,\u201D
        said the lieutenant. \u201CWhat\u2019s brewing?\u201D His voice and face
        were eager. The men behind him stared curiously. The artilleryman jumped
        down the bank into the road and saluted. \u201CGun destroyed last night,
        sir. Have been hiding. Trying to rejoin battery, sir. You\u2019ll come in
        sight of the Martians, I expect, about half a mile along this road.\u201D
        \u201CWhat the dickens are they like?\u201D asked the lieutenant. \u201CGiants
        in armour, sir. Hundred feet high. Three legs and a body like \u2019luminium,
        with a mighty great head in a hood, sir.\u201D \u201CGet out!\u201D said
        the lieutenant. \u201CWhat confounded nonsense!\u201D \u201CYou\u2019ll see,
        sir. They carry a kind of box, sir, that shoots fire and strikes you dead.\u201D
        \u201CWhat d\u2019ye mean\u2014a gun?\u201D \u201CNo, sir,\u201D and the
        artilleryman began a vivid account of the Heat-Ray. Halfway through, the
        lieutenant interrupted him and looked up at me. I was still standing on the
        bank by the side of the road. \u201CIt\u2019s perfectly true,\u201D I said.
        \u201CWell,\u201D said the lieutenant, \u201CI suppose it\u2019s my business
        to see it too. Look here\u201D\u2014to the artilleryman\u2014\u201Cwe\u2019re
        detailed here clearing people out of their houses. You\u2019d better go along
        and report yourself to Brigadier-General Marvin, and tell him all you know.
        He\u2019s at Weybridge. Know the way?\u201D \u201CI do,\u201D I said; and
        he turned his horse southward again. \u201CHalf a mile, you say?\u201D said
        he. \u201CAt most,\u201D I answered, and pointed over the treetops southward.
        He thanked me and rode on, and we saw them no more. Farther along we came
        upon a group of three women and two children in the road, busy clearing out
        a labourer\u2019s cottage. They had got hold of a little hand truck, and
        were piling it up with unclean-looking bundles and shabby furniture. They
        were all too assiduously engaged to talk to us as we passed. By Byfleet station
        we emerged from the pine trees, and found the country calm and peaceful under
        the morning sunlight. We were far beyond the range of the Heat-Ray there,
        and had it not been for the silent desertion of some of the houses, the stirring
        movement of packing in others, and the knot of soldiers standing on the bridge
        over the railway and staring down the line towards Woking, the day would
        have seemed very like any other Sunday. Several farm waggons and carts were
        moving creakily along the road to Addlestone, and suddenly through the gate
        of a field we saw, across a stretch of flat meadow, six twelve-pounders standing
        neatly at equal distances pointing towards Woking. The gunners stood by the
        guns waiting, and the ammunition waggons were at a business-like distance.
        The men stood almost as if under inspection. \u201CThat\u2019s good!\u201D
        said I. \u201CThey will get one fair shot, at any rate.\u201D The artilleryman
        hesitated at the gate. \u201CI shall go on,\u201D he said. Farther on towards
        Weybridge, just over the bridge, there were a number of men in white fatigue
        jackets throwing up a long rampart, and more guns behind. \u201CIt\u2019s
        bows and arrows against the lightning, anyhow,\u201D said the artilleryman.
        \u201CThey \u2019aven\u2019t seen that fire-beam yet.\u201D The officers
        who were not actively engaged stood and stared over the treetops southwestward,
        and the men digging would stop every now and again to stare in the same direction.
        Byfleet was in a tumult; people packing, and a score of hussars, some of
        them dismounted, some on horseback, were hunting them about. Three or four
        black government waggons, with crosses in white circles, and an old omnibus,
        among other vehicles, were being loaded in the village street. There were
        scores of people, most of them sufficiently sabbatical to have assumed their
        best clothes. The soldiers were having the greatest difficulty in making
        them realise the gravity of their position. We saw one shrivelled old fellow
        with a huge box and a score or more of flower pots containing orchids, angrily
        expostulating with the corporal who would leave them behind. I stopped and
        gripped his arm. \u201CDo you know what\u2019s over there?\u201D I said,
        pointing at the pine tops that hid the Martians. \u201CEh?\u201D said he,
        turning. \u201CI was explainin\u2019 these is vallyble.\u201D \u201CDeath!\u201D
        I shouted. \u201CDeath is coming! Death!\u201D and leaving him to digest
        that if he could, I hurried on after the artillery-man. At the corner I looked
        back. The soldier had left him, and he was still standing by his box, with
        the pots of orchids on the lid of it, and staring vaguely over the trees.
        No one in Weybridge could tell us where the headquarters were established;
        the whole place was in such confusion as I had never seen in any town before.
        Carts, carriages everywhere, the most astonishing miscellany of conveyances
        and horseflesh. The respectable inhabitants of the place, men in golf and
        boating costumes, wives prettily dressed, were packing, river-side loafers
        energetically helping, children excited, and, for the most part, highly delighted
        at this astonishing variation of their Sunday experiences. In the midst of
        it all the worthy vicar was very pluckily holding an early celebration, and
        his bell was jangling out above the excitement. I and the artilleryman, seated
        on the step of the drinking fountain, made a very passable meal upon what
        we had brought with us. Patrols of soldiers\u2014here no longer hussars,
        but grenadiers in white\u2014were warning people to move now or to take refuge
        in their cellars as soon as the firing began. We saw as we crossed the railway
        bridge that a growing crowd of people had assembled in and about the railway
        station, and the swarming platform was piled with boxes and packages. The
        ordinary traffic had been stopped, I believe, in order to allow of the passage
        of troops and guns to Chertsey, and I have heard since that a savage struggle
        occurred for places in the special trains that were put on at a later hour.
        We remained at Weybridge until midday, and at that hour we found ourselves
        at the place near Shepperton Lock where the Wey and Thames join. Part of
        the time we spent helping two old women to pack a little cart. The Wey has
        a treble mouth, and at this point boats are to be hired, and there was a
        ferry across the river. On the Shepperton side was an inn with a lawn, and
        beyond that the tower of Shepperton Church\u2014it has been replaced by a
        spire\u2014rose above the trees. Here we found an excited and noisy crowd
        of fugitives. As yet the flight had not grown to a panic, but there were
        already far more people than all the boats going to and fro could enable
        to cross. People came panting along under heavy burdens; one husband and
        wife were even carrying a small outhouse door between them, with some of
        their household goods piled thereon. One man told us he meant to try to get
        away from Shepperton station. There was a lot of shouting, and one man was
        even jesting. The idea people seemed to have here was that the Martians were
        simply formidable human beings, who might attack and sack the town, to be
        certainly destroyed in the end. Every now and then people would glance nervously
        across the Wey, at the meadows towards Chertsey, but everything over there
        was still. Across the Thames, except just where the boats landed, everything
        was quiet, in vivid contrast with the Surrey side. The people who landed
        there from the boats went tramping off down the lane. The big ferryboat had
        just made a journey. Three or four soldiers stood on the lawn of the inn,
        staring and jesting at the fugitives, without offering to help. The inn was
        closed, as it was now within prohibited hours. \u201CWhat\u2019s that?\u201D
        cried a boatman, and \u201CShut up, you fool!\u201D said a man near me to
        a yelping dog. Then the sound came again, this time from the direction of
        Chertsey, a muffled thud\u2014the sound of a gun. The fighting was beginning.
        Almost immediately unseen batteries across the river to our right, unseen
        because of the trees, took up the chorus, firing heavily one after the other.
        A woman screamed. Everyone stood arrested by the sudden stir of battle, near
        us and yet invisible to us. Nothing was to be seen save flat meadows, cows
        feeding unconcernedly for the most part, and silvery pollard willows motionless
        in the warm sunlight. \u201CThe sojers\u2019ll stop \u2019em,\u201D said
        a woman beside me, doubtfully. A haziness rose over the treetops. Then suddenly
        we saw a rush of smoke far away up the river, a puff of smoke that jerked
        up into the air and hung; and forthwith the ground heaved under foot and
        a heavy explosion shook the air, smashing two or three windows in the houses
        near, and leaving us astonished. \u201CHere they are!\u201D shouted a man
        in a blue jersey. \u201CYonder! D\u2019yer see them? Yonder!\u201D Quickly,
        one after the other, one, two, three, four of the armoured Martians appeared,
        far away over the little trees, across the flat meadows that stretched towards
        Chertsey, and striding hurriedly towards the river. Little cowled figures
        they seemed at first, going with a rolling motion and as fast as flying birds.
        Then, advancing obliquely towards us, came a fifth. Their armoured bodies
        glittered in the sun as they swept swiftly forward upon the guns, growing
        rapidly larger as they drew nearer. One on the extreme left, the remotest
        that is, flourished a huge case high in the air, and the ghostly, terrible
        Heat-Ray I had already seen on Friday night smote towards Chertsey, and struck
        the town. At sight of these strange, swift, and terrible creatures the crowd
        near the water\u2019s edge seemed to me to be for a moment horror-struck.
        There was no screaming or shouting, but a silence. Then a hoarse murmur and
        a movement of feet\u2014a splashing from the water. A man, too frightened
        to drop the portmanteau he carried on his shoulder, swung round and sent
        me staggering with a blow from the corner of his burden. A woman thrust at
        me with her hand and rushed past me. I turned with the rush of the people,
        but I was not too terrified for thought. The terrible Heat-Ray was in my
        mind. To get under water! That was it! \u201CGet under water!\u201D I shouted,
        unheeded. I faced about again, and rushed towards the approaching Martian,
        rushed right down the gravelly beach and headlong into the water. Others
        did the same. A boatload of people putting back came leaping out as I rushed
        past. The stones under my feet were muddy and slippery, and the river was
        so low that I ran perhaps twenty feet scarcely waist-deep. Then, as the Martian
        towered overhead scarcely a couple of hundred yards away, I flung myself
        forward under the surface. The splashes of the people in the boats leaping
        into the river sounded like thunderclaps in my ears. People were landing
        hastily on both sides of the river. But the Martian machine took no more
        notice for the moment of the people running this way and that than a man
        would of the confusion of ants in a nest against which his foot has kicked.
        When, half suffocated, I raised my head above water, the Martian\u2019s hood
        pointed at the batteries that were still firing across the river, and as
        it advanced it swung loose what must have been the generator of the Heat-Ray.
        In another moment it was on the bank, and in a stride wading halfway across.
        The knees of its foremost legs bent at the farther bank, and in another moment
        it had raised itself to its full height again, close to the village of Shepperton.
        Forthwith the six guns which, unknown to anyone on the right bank, had been
        hidden behind the outskirts of that village, fired simultaneously. The sudden
        near concussion, the last close upon the first, made my heart jump. The monster
        was already raising the case generating the Heat-Ray as the first shell burst
        six yards above the hood. I gave a cry of astonishment. I saw and thought
        nothing of the other four Martian monsters; my attention was riveted upon
        the nearer incident. Simultaneously two other shells burst in the air near
        the body as the hood twisted round in time to receive, but not in time to
        dodge, the fourth shell. The shell burst clean in the face of the Thing.
        The hood bulged, flashed, was whirled off in a dozen tattered fragments of
        red flesh and glittering metal. \u201CHit!\u201D shouted I, with something
        between a scream and a cheer. I heard answering shouts from the people in
        the water about me. I could have leaped out of the water with that momentary
        exultation. The decapitated colossus reeled like a drunken giant; but it
        did not fall over. It recovered its balance by a miracle, and, no longer
        heeding its steps and with the camera that fired the Heat-Ray now rigidly
        upheld, it reeled swiftly upon Shepperton. The living intelligence, the Martian
        within the hood, was slain and splashed to the four winds of heaven, and
        the Thing was now but a mere intricate device of metal whirling to destruction.
        It drove along in a straight line, incapable of guidance. It struck the tower
        of Shepperton Church, smashing it down as the impact of a battering ram might
        have done, swerved aside, blundered on and collapsed with tremendous force
        into the river out of my sight. A violent explosion shook the air, and a
        spout of water, steam, mud, and shattered metal shot far up into the sky.
        As the camera of the Heat-Ray hit the water, the latter had immediately flashed
        into steam. In another moment a huge wave, like a muddy tidal bore but almost
        scaldingly hot, came sweeping round the bend upstream. I saw people struggling
        shorewards, and heard their screaming and shouting faintly above the seething
        and roar of the Martian\u2019s collapse. For a moment I heeded nothing of
        the heat, forgot the patent need of self-preservation. I splashed through
        the tumultuous water, pushing aside a man in black to do so, until I could
        see round the bend. Half a dozen deserted boats pitched aimlessly upon the
        confusion of the waves. The fallen Martian came into sight downstream, lying
        across the river, and for the most part submerged. Thick clouds of steam
        were pouring off the wreckage, and through the tumultuously whirling wisps
        I could see, intermittently and vaguely, the gigantic limbs churning the
        water and flinging a splash and spray of mud and froth into the air. The
        tentacles swayed and struck like living arms, and, save for the helpless
        purposelessness of these movements, it was as if some wounded thing were
        struggling for its life amid the waves. Enormous quantities of a ruddy-brown
        fluid were spurting up in noisy jets out of the machine. My attention was
        diverted from this death flurry by a furious yelling, like that of the thing
        called a siren in our manufacturing towns. A man, knee-deep near the towing
        path, shouted inaudibly to me and pointed. Looking back, I saw the other
        Martians advancing with gigantic strides down the riverbank from the direction
        of Chertsey. The Shepperton guns spoke this time unavailingly. At that I
        ducked at once under water, and, holding my breath until movement was an
        agony, blundered painfully ahead under the surface as long as I could. The
        water was in a tumult about me, and rapidly growing hotter. When for a moment
        I raised my head to take breath and throw the hair and water from my eyes,
        the steam was rising in a whirling white fog that at first hid the Martians
        altogether. The noise was deafening. Then I saw them dimly, colossal figures
        of grey, magnified by the mist. They had passed by me, and two were stooping
        over the frothing, tumultuous ruins of their comrade. The third and fourth
        stood beside him in the water, one perhaps two hundred yards from me, the
        other towards Laleham. The generators of the Heat-Rays waved high, and the
        hissing beams smote down this way and that. The air was full of sound, a
        deafening and confusing conflict of noises\u2014the clangorous din of the
        Martians, the crash of falling houses, the thud of trees, fences, sheds flashing
        into flame, and the crackling and roaring of fire. Dense black smoke was
        leaping up to mingle with the steam from the river, and as the Heat-Ray went
        to and fro over Weybridge its impact was marked by flashes of incandescent
        white, that gave place at once to a smoky dance of lurid flames. The nearer
        houses still stood intact, awaiting their fate, shadowy, faint and pallid
        in the steam, with the fire behind them going to and fro. For a moment perhaps
        I stood there, breast-high in the almost boiling water, dumbfounded at my
        position, hopeless of escape. Through the reek I could see the people who
        had been with me in the river scrambling out of the water through the reeds,
        like little frogs hurrying through grass from the advance of a man, or running
        to and fro in utter dismay on the towing path. Then suddenly the white flashes
        of the Heat-Ray came leaping towards me. The houses caved in as they dissolved
        at its touch, and darted out flames; the trees changed to fire with a roar.
        The Ray flickered up and down the towing path, licking off the people who
        ran this way and that, and came down to the water\u2019s edge not fifty yards
        from where I stood. It swept across the river to Shepperton, and the water
        in its track rose in a boiling weal crested with steam. I turned shoreward.
        In another moment the huge wave, well-nigh at the boiling-point had rushed
        upon me. I screamed aloud, and scalded, half blinded, agonised, I staggered
        through the leaping, hissing water towards the shore. Had my foot stumbled,
        it would have been the end. I fell helplessly, in full sight of the Martians,
        upon the broad, bare gravelly spit that runs down to mark the angle of the
        Wey and Thames. I expected nothing but death. I have a dim memory of the
        foot of a Martian coming down within a score of yards of my head, driving
        straight into the loose gravel, whirling it this way and that and lifting
        again; of a long suspense, and then of the four carrying the debris of their
        comrade between them, now clear and then presently faint through a veil of
        smoke, receding interminably, as it seemed to me, across a vast space of
        river and meadow. And then, very slowly, I realised that by a miracle I had
        escaped."
