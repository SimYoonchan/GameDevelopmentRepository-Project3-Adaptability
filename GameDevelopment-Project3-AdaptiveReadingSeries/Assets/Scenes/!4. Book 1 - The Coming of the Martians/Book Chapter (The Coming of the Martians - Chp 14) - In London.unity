      value: "My younger brother was in London when the Martians fell at Woking.
        He was a medical student working for an imminent examination, and he heard
        nothing of the arrival until Saturday morning. The morning papers on Saturday
        contained, in addition to lengthy special articles on the planet Mars, on
        life in the planets, and so forth, a brief and vaguely worded telegram, all
        the more striking for its brevity. The Martians, alarmed by the approach
        of a crowd, had killed a number of people with a quick-firing gun, so the
        story ran. The telegram concluded with the words: \u201CFormidable as they
        seem to be, the Martians have not moved from the pit into which they have
        fallen, and, indeed, seem incapable of doing so. Probably this is due to
        the relative strength of the earth\u2019s gravitational energy.\u201D On
        that last text their leader-writer expanded very comfortingly. Of course
        all the students in the crammer\u2019s biology class, to which my brother
        went that day, were intensely interested, but there were no signs of any
        unusual excitement in the streets. The afternoon papers puffed scraps of
        news under big headlines. They had nothing to tell beyond the movements of
        troops about the common, and the burning of the pine woods between Woking
        and Weybridge, until eight. Then the St. James\u2019s Gazette, in an extra-special
        edition, announced the bare fact of the interruption of telegraphic communication.
        This was thought to be due to the falling of burning pine trees across the
        line. Nothing more of the fighting was known that night, the night of my
        drive to Leatherhead and back. My brother felt no anxiety about us, as he
        knew from the description in the papers that the cylinder was a good two
        miles from my house. He made up his mind to run down that night to me, in
        order, as he says, to see the Things before they were killed. He dispatched
        a telegram, which never reached me, about four o\u2019clock, and spent the
        evening at a music hall. In London, also, on Saturday night there was a thunderstorm,
        and my brother reached Waterloo in a cab. On the platform from which the
        midnight train usually starts he learned, after some waiting, that an accident
        prevented trains from reaching Woking that night. The nature of the accident
        he could not ascertain; indeed, the railway authorities did not clearly know
        at that time. There was very little excitement in the station, as the officials,
        failing to realise that anything further than a breakdown between Byfleet
        and Woking junction had occurred, were running the theatre trains which usually
        passed through Woking round by Virginia Water or Guildford. They were busy
        making the necessary arrangements to alter the route of the Southampton and
        Portsmouth Sunday League excursions. A nocturnal newspaper reporter, mistaking
        my brother for the traffic manager, to whom he bears a slight resemblance,
        waylaid and tried to interview him. Few people, excepting the railway officials,
        connected the breakdown with the Martians. I have read, in another account
        of these events, that on Sunday morning \u201Call London was electrified
        by the news from Woking.\u201D As a matter of fact, there was nothing to
        justify that very extravagant phrase. Plenty of Londoners did not hear of
        the Martians until the panic of Monday morning. Those who did took some time
        to realise all that the hastily worded telegrams in the Sunday papers conveyed.
        The majority of people in London do not read Sunday papers. The habit of
        personal security, moreover, is so deeply fixed in the Londoner\u2019s mind,
        and startling intelligence so much a matter of course in the papers, that
        they could read without any personal tremors: \u201CAbout seven o\u2019clock
        last night the Martians came out of the cylinder, and, moving about under
        an armour of metallic shields, have completely wrecked Woking station with
        the adjacent houses, and massacred an entire battalion of the Cardigan Regiment.
        No details are known. Maxims have been absolutely useless against their armour;
        the field guns have been disabled by them. Flying hussars have been galloping
        into Chertsey. The Martians appear to be moving slowly towards Chertsey or
        Windsor. Great anxiety prevails in West Surrey, and earthworks are being
        thrown up to check the advance Londonward.\u201D That was how the Sunday
        Sun put it, and a clever and remarkably prompt \u201Chandbook\u201D article
        in the Refereecompared the affair to a menagerie suddenly let loose in a
        village. No one in London knew positively of the nature of the armoured Martians,
        and there was still a fixed idea that these monsters must be sluggish: \u201Ccrawling,\u201D
        \u201Ccreeping painfully\u201D\u2014such expressions occurred in almost all
        the earlier reports. None of the telegrams could have been written by an
        eyewitness of their advance. The Sunday papers printed separate editions
        as further news came to hand, some even in default of it. But there was practically
        nothing more to tell people until late in the afternoon, when the authorities
        gave the press agencies the news in their possession. It was stated that
        the people of Walton and Weybridge, and all the district were pouring along
        the roads Londonward, and that was all. My brother went to church at the
        Foundling Hospital in the morning, still in ignorance of what had happened
        on the previous night. There he heard allusions made to the invasion, and
        a special prayer for peace. Coming out, he bought a Referee. He became alarmed
        at the news in this, and went again to Waterloo station to find out if communication
        were restored. The omnibuses, carriages, cyclists, and innumerable people
        walking in their best clothes seemed scarcely affected by the strange intelligence
        that the newsvendors were disseminating. People were interested, or, if alarmed,
        alarmed only on account of the local residents. At the station he heard for
        the first time that the Windsor and Chertsey lines were now interrupted.
        The porters told him that several remarkable telegrams had been received
        in the morning from Byfleet and Chertsey stations, but that these had abruptly
        ceased. My brother could get very little precise detail out of them. \u201CThere\u2019s
        fighting going on about Weybridge\u201D was the extent of their information.
        The train service was now very much disorganised. Quite a number of people
        who had been expecting friends from places on the South-Western network were
        standing about the station. One grey-headed old gentleman came and abused
        the South-Western Company bitterly to my brother. \u201CIt wants showing
        up,\u201D he said. One or two trains came in from Richmond, Putney, and Kingston,
        containing people who had gone out for a day\u2019s boating and found the
        locks closed and a feeling of panic in the air. A man in a blue and white
        blazer addressed my brother, full of strange tidings. \u201CThere\u2019s
        hosts of people driving into Kingston in traps and carts and things, with
        boxes of valuables and all that,\u201D he said. \u201CThey come from Molesey
        and Weybridge and Walton, and they say there\u2019s been guns heard at Chertsey,
        heavy firing, and that mounted soldiers have told them to get off at once
        because the Martians are coming. We heard guns firing at Hampton Court station,
        but we thought it was thunder. What the dickens does it all mean? The Martians
        can\u2019t get out of their pit, can they?\u201D My brother could not tell
        him. Afterwards he found that the vague feeling of alarm had spread to the
        clients of the underground railway, and that the Sunday excursionists began
        to return from all over the South-Western \u201Clung\u201D\u2014Barnes, Wimbledon,
        Richmond Park, Kew, and so forth\u2014at unnaturally early hours; but not
        a soul had anything more than vague hearsay to tell of. Everyone connected
        with the terminus seemed ill-tempered. About five o\u2019clock the gathering
        crowd in the station was immensely excited by the opening of the line of
        communication, which is almost invariably closed, between the South-Eastern
        and the South-Western stations, and the passage of carriage trucks bearing
        huge guns and carriages crammed with soldiers. These were the guns that were
        brought up from Woolwich and Chatham to cover Kingston. There was an exchange
        of pleasantries: \u201CYou\u2019ll get eaten!\u201D \u201CWe\u2019re the
        beast-tamers!\u201D and so forth. A little while after that a squad of police
        came into the station and began to clear the public off the platforms, and
        my brother went out into the street again. The church bells were ringing
        for evensong, and a squad of Salvation Army lassies came singing down Waterloo
        Road. On the bridge a number of loafers were watching a curious brown scum
        that came drifting down the stream in patches. The sun was just setting,
        and the Clock Tower and the Houses of Parliament rose against one of the
        most peaceful skies it is possible to imagine, a sky of gold, barred with
        long transverse stripes of reddish-purple cloud. There was talk of a floating
        body. One of the men there, a reservist he said he was, told my brother he
        had seen the heliograph flickering in the west. In Wellington Street my brother
        met a couple of sturdy roughs who had just been rushed out of Fleet Street
        with still-wet newspapers and staring placards. \u201CDreadful catastrophe!\u201D
        they bawled one to the other down Wellington Street. \u201CFighting at Weybridge!
        Full description! Repulse of the Martians! London in Danger!\u201D He had
        to give threepence for a copy of that paper. Then it was, and then only,
        that he realised something of the full power and terror of these monsters.
        He learned that they were not merely a handful of small sluggish creatures,
        but that they were minds swaying vast mechanical bodies; and that they could
        move swiftly and smite with such power that even the mightiest guns could
        not stand against them. They were described as \u201Cvast spiderlike machines,
        nearly a hundred feet high, capable of the speed of an express train, and
        able to shoot out a beam of intense heat.\u201D Masked batteries, chiefly
        of field guns, had been planted in the country about Horsell Common, and
        especially between the Woking district and London. Five of the machines had
        been seen moving towards the Thames, and one, by a happy chance, had been
        destroyed. In the other cases the shells had missed, and the batteries had
        been at once annihilated by the Heat-Rays. Heavy losses of soldiers were
        mentioned, but the tone of the dispatch was optimistic. The Martians had
        been repulsed; they were not invulnerable. They had retreated to their triangle
        of cylinders again, in the circle about Woking. Signallers with heliographs
        were pushing forward upon them from all sides. Guns were in rapid transit
        from Windsor, Portsmouth, Aldershot, Woolwich\u2014even from the north; among
        others, long wire-guns of ninety-five tons from Woolwich. Altogether one
        hundred and sixteen were in position or being hastily placed, chiefly covering
        London. Never before in England had there been such a vast or rapid concentration
        of military material. Any further cylinders that fell, it was hoped, could
        be destroyed at once by high explosives, which were being rapidly manufactured
        and distributed. No doubt, ran the report, the situation was of the strangest
        and gravest description, but the public was exhorted to avoid and discourage
        panic. No doubt the Martians were strange and terrible in the extreme, but
        at the outside there could not be more than twenty of them against our millions.
        The authorities had reason to suppose, from the size of the cylinders, that
        at the outside there could not be more than five in each cylinder\u2014fifteen
        altogether. And one at least was disposed of\u2014perhaps more. The public
        would be fairly warned of the approach of danger, and elaborate measures
        were being taken for the protection of the people in the threatened southwestern
        suburbs. And so, with reiterated assurances of the safety of London and the
        ability of the authorities to cope with the difficulty, this quasi-proclamation
        closed. This was printed in enormous type on paper so fresh that it was still
        wet, and there had been no time to add a word of comment. It was curious,
        my brother said, to see how ruthlessly the usual contents of the paper had
        been hacked and taken out to give this place. All down Wellington Street
        people could be seen fluttering out the pink sheets and reading, and the
        Strand was suddenly noisy with the voices of an army of hawkers following
        these pioneers. Men came scrambling off buses to secure copies. Certainly
        this news excited people intensely, whatever their previous apathy. The shutters
        of a map shop in the Strand were being taken down, my brother said, and a
        man in his Sunday raiment, lemon-yellow gloves even, was visible inside the
        window hastily fastening maps of Surrey to the glass. Going on along the
        Strand to Trafalgar Square, the paper in his hand, my brother saw some of
        the fugitives from West Surrey. There was a man with his wife and two boys
        and some articles of furniture in a cart such as greengrocers use. He was
        driving from the direction of Westminster Bridge; and close behind him came
        a hay waggon with five or six respectable-looking people in it, and some
        boxes and bundles. The faces of these people were haggard, and their entire
        appearance contrasted conspicuously with the Sabbath-best appearance of the
        people on the omnibuses. People in fashionable clothing peeped at them out
        of cabs. They stopped at the Square as if undecided which way to take, and
        finally turned eastward along the Strand. Some way behind these came a man
        in workday clothes, riding one of those old-fashioned tricycles with a small
        front wheel. He was dirty and white in the face. My brother turned down towards
        Victoria, and met a number of such people. He had a vague idea that he might
        see something of me. He noticed an unusual number of police regulating the
        traffic. Some of the refugees were exchanging news with the people on the
        omnibuses. One was professing to have seen the Martians. \u201CBoilers on
        stilts, I tell you, striding along like men.\u201D Most of them were excited
        and animated by their strange experience. Beyond Victoria the public-houses
        were doing a lively trade with these arrivals. At all the street corners
        groups of people were reading papers, talking excitedly, or staring at these
        unusual Sunday visitors. They seemed to increase as night drew on, until
        at last the roads, my brother said, were like Epsom High Street on a Derby
        Day. My brother addressed several of these fugitives and got unsatisfactory
        answers from most. None of them could tell him any news of Woking except
        one man, who assured him that Woking had been entirely destroyed on the previous
        night. \u201CI come from Byfleet,\u201D he said; \u201Ca man on a bicycle
        came through the place in the early morning, and ran from door to door warning
        us to come away. Then came soldiers. We went out to look, and there were
        clouds of smoke to the south\u2014nothing but smoke, and not a soul coming
        that way. Then we heard the guns at Chertsey, and folks coming from Weybridge.
        So I\u2019ve locked up my house and come on.\u201D At that time there was
        a strong feeling in the streets that the authorities were to blame for their
        incapacity to dispose of the invaders without all this inconvenience. About
        eight o\u2019clock a noise of heavy firing was distinctly audible all over
        the south of London. My brother could not hear it for the traffic in the
        main thoroughfares, but by striking through the quiet back streets to the
        river he was able to distinguish it quite plainly. He walked from Westminster
        to his apartments near Regent\u2019s Park, about two. He was now very anxious
        on my account, and disturbed at the evident magnitude of the trouble. His
        mind was inclined to run, even as mine had run on Saturday, on military details.
        He thought of all those silent, expectant guns, of the suddenly nomadic countryside;
        he tried to imagine \u201Cboilers on stilts\u201D a hundred feet high. There
        were one or two cartloads of refugees passing along Oxford Street, and several
        in the Marylebone Road, but so slowly was the news spreading that Regent
        Street and Portland Place were full of their usual Sunday-night promenaders,
        albeit they talked in groups, and along the edge of Regent\u2019s Park there
        were as many silent couples \u201Cwalking out\u201D together under the scattered
        gas lamps as ever there had been. The night was warm and still, and a little
        oppressive; the sound of guns continued intermittently, and after midnight
        there seemed to be sheet lightning in the south. He read and re-read the
        paper, fearing the worst had happened to me. He was restless, and after supper
        prowled out again aimlessly. He returned and tried in vain to divert his
        attention to his examination notes. He went to bed a little after midnight,
        and was awakened from lurid dreams in the small hours of Monday by the sound
        of door knockers, feet running in the street, distant drumming, and a clamour
        of bells. Red reflections danced on the ceiling. For a moment he lay astonished,
        wondering whether day had come or the world gone mad. Then he jumped out
        of bed and ran to the window. His room was an attic and as he thrust his
        head out, up and down the street there were a dozen echoes to the noise of
        his window sash, and heads in every kind of night disarray appeared. Enquiries
        were being shouted. \u201CThey are coming!\u201D bawled a policeman, hammering
        at the door; \u201Cthe Martians are coming!\u201D and hurried to the next
        door. The sound of drumming and trumpeting came from the Albany Street Barracks,
        and every church within earshot was hard at work killing sleep with a vehement
        disorderly tocsin. There was a noise of doors opening, and window after window
        in the houses opposite flashed from darkness into yellow illumination. Up
        the street came galloping a closed carriage, bursting abruptly into noise
        at the corner, rising to a clattering climax under the window, and dying
        away slowly in the distance. Close on the rear of this came a couple of cabs,
        the forerunners of a long procession of flying vehicles, going for the most
        part to Chalk Farm station, where the North-Western special trains were loading
        up, instead of coming down the gradient into Euston. For a long time my brother
        stared out of the window in blank astonishment, watching the policemen hammering
        at door after door, and delivering their incomprehensible message. Then the
        door behind him opened, and the man who lodged across the landing came in,
        dressed only in shirt, trousers, and slippers, his braces loose about his
        waist, his hair disordered from his pillow. \u201CWhat the devil is it?\u201D
        he asked. \u201CA fire? What a devil of a row!\u201D They both craned their
        heads out of the window, straining to hear what the policemen were shouting.
        People were coming out of the side streets, and standing in groups at the
        corners talking. \u201CWhat the devil is it all about?\u201D said my brother\u2019s
        fellow lodger. My brother answered him vaguely and began to dress, running
        with each garment to the window in order to miss nothing of the growing excitement.
        And presently men selling unnaturally early newspapers came bawling into
        the street: \u201CLondon in danger of suffocation! The Kingston and Richmond
        defences forced! Fearful massacres in the Thames Valley!\u201D And all about
        him\u2014in the rooms below, in the houses on each side and across the road,
        and behind in the Park Terraces and in the hundred other streets of that
        part of Marylebone, and the Westbourne Park district and St. Pancras, and
        westward and northward in Kilburn and St. John\u2019s Wood and Hampstead,
        and eastward in Shoreditch and Highbury and Haggerston and Hoxton, and, indeed,
        through all the vastness of London from Ealing to East Ham\u2014people were
        rubbing their eyes, and opening windows to stare out and ask aimless questions,
        dressing hastily as the first breath of the coming storm of Fear blew through
        the streets. It was the dawn of the great panic. London, which had gone to
        bed on Sunday night oblivious and inert, was awakened, in the small hours
        of Monday morning, to a vivid sense of danger. Unable from his window to
        learn what was happening, my brother went down and out into the street, just
        as the sky between the parapets of the houses grew pink with the early dawn.
        The flying people on foot and in vehicles grew more numerous every moment.
        \u201CBlack Smoke!\u201D he heard people crying, and again \u201CBlack Smoke!\u201D
        The contagion of such a unanimous fear was inevitable. As my brother hesitated
        on the door-step, he saw another newsvendor approaching, and got a paper
        forthwith. The man was running away with the rest, and selling his papers
        for a shilling each as he ran\u2014a grotesque mingling of profit and panic.
        And from this paper my brother read that catastrophic dispatch of the Commander-in-Chief:
        \u201CThe Martians are able to discharge enormous clouds of a black and poisonous
        vapour by means of rockets. They have smothered our batteries, destroyed
        Richmond, Kingston, and Wimbledon, and are advancing slowly towards London,
        destroying everything on the way. It is impossible to stop them. There is
        no safety from the Black Smoke but in instant flight.\u201D That was all,
        but it was enough. The whole population of the great six-million city was
        stirring, slipping, running; presently it would be pouring en masse northward.
        \u201CBlack Smoke!\u201D the voices cried. \u201CFire!\u201D The bells of
        the neighbouring church made a jangling tumult, a cart carelessly driven
        smashed, amid shrieks and curses, against the water trough up the street.
        Sickly yellow lights went to and fro in the houses, and some of the passing
        cabs flaunted unextinguished lamps. And overhead the dawn was growing brighter,
        clear and steady and calm. He heard footsteps running to and fro in the rooms,
        and up and down stairs behind him. His landlady came to the door, loosely
        wrapped in dressing gown and shawl; her husband followed, ejaculating. As
        my brother began to realise the import of all these things, he turned hastily
        to his own room, put all his available money\u2014some ten pounds altogether\u2014into
        his pockets, and went out again into the streets. "
