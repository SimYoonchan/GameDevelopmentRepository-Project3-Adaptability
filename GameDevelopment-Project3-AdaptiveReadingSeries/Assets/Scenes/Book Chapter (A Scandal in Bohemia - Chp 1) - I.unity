      value: "To Sherlock Holmes she is always the woman. I have seldom heard him
        mention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses and predominates
        the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for
        Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one particularly, were abhorrent to his
        cold, precise but admirably balanced mind. He was, I take it, the most perfect
        reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen, but as a lover he
        would have placed himself in a false position. He never spoke of the softer
        passions, save with a gibe and a sneer. They were admirable things for the
        observer\u2014excellent for drawing the veil from men\u2019s motives and
        actions. But for the trained reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own
        delicate and finely adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor
        which might throw a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a sensitive
        instrument, or a crack in one of his own high-power lenses, would not be
        more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his. And yet there
        was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene Adler, of dubious
        and questionable memory. I had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage
        had drifted us away from each other. My own complete happiness, and the home-centred
        interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master of
        his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all my attention, while
        Holmes, who loathed every form of society with his whole Bohemian soul, remained
        in our lodgings in Baker Street, buried among his old books, and alternating
        from week to week between cocaine and ambition, the drowsiness of the drug,
        and the fierce energy of his own keen nature. He was still, as ever, deeply
        attracted by the study of crime, and occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary
        powers of observation in following out those clues, and clearing up those
        mysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police. From
        time to time I heard some vague account of his doings: of his summons to
        Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up of the singular
        tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee, and finally of the mission
        which he had accomplished so delicately and successfully for the reigning
        family of Holland. Beyond these signs of his activity, however, which I merely
        shared with all the readers of the daily press, I knew little of my former
        friend and companion. One night\u2014it was on the twentieth of March, 1888\u2014I
        was returning from a journey to a patient (for I had now returned to civil
        practice), when my way led me through Baker Street. As I passed the well-remembered
        door, which must always be associated in my mind with my wooing, and with
        the dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a keen desire
        to see Holmes again, and to know how he was employing his extraordinary powers.
        His rooms were brilliantly lit, and, even as I looked up, I saw his tall,
        spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against the blind. He was pacing
        the room swiftly, eagerly, with his head sunk upon his chest and his hands
        clasped behind him. To me, who knew his every mood and habit, his attitude
        and manner told their own story. He was at work again. He had risen out of
        his drug-created dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem. I
        rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in
        part my own. His manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad,
        I think, to see me. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he
        waved me to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars, and indicated a
        spirit case and a gasogene in the corner. Then he stood before the fire and
        looked me over in his singular introspective fashion. \u201CWedlock suits
        you,\u201D he remarked. \u201CI think, Watson, that you have put on seven
        and a half pounds since I saw you.\u201D \u201CSeven!\u201D I answered. \u201CIndeed,
        I should have thought a little more. Just a trifle more, I fancy, Watson.
        And in practice again, I observe. You did not tell me that you intended to
        go into harness.\u201D \u201CThen, how do you know?\u201D \u201CI see it,
        I deduce it. How do I know that you have been getting yourself very wet lately,
        and that you have a most clumsy and careless servant girl?\u201D \u201CMy
        dear Holmes,\u201D said I, \u201Cthis is too much. You would certainly have
        been burned, had you lived a few centuries ago. It is true that I had a country
        walk on Thursday and came home in a dreadful mess, but as I have changed
        my clothes I can\u2019t imagine how you deduce it. As to Mary Jane, she is
        incorrigible, and my wife has given her notice, but there, again, I fail
        to see how you work it out.\u201D He chuckled to himself and rubbed his long,
        nervous hands together. \u201CIt is simplicity itself,\u201D said he; \u201Cmy
        eyes tell me that on the inside of your left shoe, just where the firelight
        strikes it, the leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts. Obviously
        they have been caused by someone who has very carelessly scraped round the
        edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it. Hence, you see,
        my double deduction that you had been out in vile weather, and that you had
        a particularly malignant boot-slitting specimen of the London slavey. As
        to your practice, if a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of iodoform,
        with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right forefinger, and a bulge
        on the right side of his top-hat to show where he has secreted his stethoscope,
        I must be dull, indeed, if I do not pronounce him to be an active member
        of the medical profession.\u201D I could not help laughing at the ease with
        which he explained his process of deduction. \u201CWhen I hear you give your
        reasons,\u201D I remarked, \u201Cthe thing always appears to me to be so
        ridiculously simple that I could easily do it myself, though at each successive
        instance of your reasoning I am baffled until you explain your process. And
        yet I believe that my eyes are as good as yours.\u201D \u201CQuite so,\u201D
        he answered, lighting a cigarette, and throwing himself down into an armchair.
        \u201CYou see, but you do not observe. The distinction is clear. For example,
        you have frequently seen the steps which lead up from the hall to this room.\u201D
        \u201CFrequently.\u201D \u201CHow often?\u201D \u201CWell, some hundreds
        of times.\u201D \u201CThen how many are there?\u201D \u201CHow many? I don\u2019t
        know.\u201D \u201CQuite so! You have not observed. And yet you have seen.
        That is just my point. Now, I know that there are seventeen steps, because
        I have both seen and observed. By the way, since you are interested in these
        little problems, and since you are good enough to chronicle one or two of
        my trifling experiences, you may be interested in this.\u201D He threw over
        a sheet of thick, pink-tinted notepaper which had been lying open upon the
        table. \u201CIt came by the last post,\u201D said he. \u201CRead it aloud.\u201D
        The note was undated, and without either signature or address. \u201CThere
        will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight o\u2019clock,\u201D it
        said, \u201Ca gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very
        deepest moment. Your recent services to one of the royal houses of Europe
        have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted with matters which
        are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated. This account of you
        we have from all quarters received. Be in your chamber then at that hour,
        and do not take it amiss if your visitor wear a mask.\u201D \u201CThis is
        indeed a mystery,\u201D I remarked. \u201CWhat do you imagine that it means?\u201D
        \u201CI have no data yet. It is a capital mistake to theorise before one
        has data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead
        of theories to suit facts. But the note itself. What do you deduce from it?\u201D
        I carefully examined the writing, and the paper upon which it was written.
        \u201CThe man who wrote it was presumably well to do,\u201D I remarked, endeavouring
        to imitate my companion\u2019s processes. \u201CSuch paper could not be bought
        under half a crown a packet. It is peculiarly strong and stiff.\u201D \u201CPeculiar\u2014that
        is the very word,\u201D said Holmes. \u201CIt is not an English paper at
        all. Hold it up to the light.\u201D I did so, and saw a large \u201CE\u201D
        with a small \u201Cg,\u201D a \u201CP,\u201D and a large \u201CG\u201D with
        a small \u201Ct\u201D woven into the texture of the paper. \u201CWhat do
        you make of that?\u201D asked Holmes. \u201CThe name of the maker, no doubt;
        or his monogram, rather.\u201D \u201CNot at all. The \u2018G\u2019 with the
        small \u2018t\u2019 stands for \u2018Gesellschaft,\u2019 which is the German
        for \u2018Company.\u2019 It is a customary contraction like our \u2018Co.\u2019
        \u2018P,\u2019 of course, stands for \u2018Papier.\u2019 Now for the \u2018Eg.\u2019
        Let us glance at our Continental Gazetteer.\u201D He took down a heavy brown
        volume from his shelves. \u201CEglow, Eglonitz\u2014here we are, Egria. It
        is in a German-speaking country\u2014in Bohemia, not far from Carlsbad. \u2018Remarkable
        as being the scene of the death of Wallenstein, and for its numerous glass-factories
        and paper-mills.\u2019 Ha, ha, my boy, what do you make of that?\u201D His
        eyes sparkled, and he sent up a great blue triumphant cloud from his cigarette.
        \u201CThe paper was made in Bohemia,\u201D I said. \u201CPrecisely. And the
        man who wrote the note is a German. Do you note the peculiar construction
        of the sentence\u2014\u2018This account of you we have from all quarters
        received.\u2019 A Frenchman or Russian could not have written that. It is
        the German who is so uncourteous to his verbs. It only remains, therefore,
        to discover what is wanted by this German who writes upon Bohemian paper
        and prefers wearing a mask to showing his face. And here he comes, if I am
        not mistaken, to resolve all our doubts.\u201D As he spoke there was the
        sharp sound of horses\u2019 hoofs and grating wheels against the curb, followed
        by a sharp pull at the bell. Holmes whistled. \u201CA pair, by the sound,\u201D
        said he. \u201CYes,\u201D he continued, glancing out of the window. \u201CA
        nice little brougham and a pair of beauties. A hundred and fifty guineas
        apiece. There\u2019s money in this case, Watson, if there is nothing else.\u201D
        \u201CI think that I had better go, Holmes.\u201D \u201CNot a bit, Doctor.
        Stay where you are. I am lost without my Boswell. And this promises to be
        interesting. It would be a pity to miss it.\u201D \u201CBut your client\u2014\u201D
        \u201CNever mind him. I may want your help, and so may he. Here he comes.
        Sit down in that armchair, Doctor, and give us your best attention.\u201D
        A slow and heavy step, which had been heard upon the stairs and in the passage,
        paused immediately outside the door. Then there was a loud and authoritative
        tap. \u201CCome in!\u201D said Holmes. A man entered who could hardly have
        been less than six feet six inches in height, with the chest and limbs of
        a Hercules. His dress was rich with a richness which would, in England, be
        looked upon as akin to bad taste. Heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed across
        the sleeves and fronts of his double-breasted coat, while the deep blue cloak
        which was thrown over his shoulders was lined with flame-coloured silk and
        secured at the neck with a brooch which consisted of a single flaming beryl.
        Boots which extended halfway up his calves, and which were trimmed at the
        tops with rich brown fur, completed the impression of barbaric opulence which
        was suggested by his whole appearance. He carried a broad-brimmed hat in
        his hand, while he wore across the upper part of his face, extending down
        past the cheekbones, a black vizard mask, which he had apparently adjusted
        that very moment, for his hand was still raised to it as he entered. From
        the lower part of the face he appeared to be a man of strong character, with
        a thick, hanging lip, and a long, straight chin suggestive of resolution
        pushed to the length of obstinacy. \u201CYou had my note?\u201D he asked
        with a deep harsh voice and a strongly marked German accent. \u201CI told
        you that I would call.\u201D He looked from one to the other of us, as if
        uncertain which to address. \u201CPray take a seat,\u201D said Holmes. \u201CThis
        is my friend and colleague, Dr. Watson, who is occasionally good enough to
        help me in my cases. Whom have I the honour to address?\u201D \u201CYou may
        address me as the Count Von Kramm, a Bohemian nobleman. I understand that
        this gentleman, your friend, is a man of honour and discretion, whom I may
        trust with a matter of the most extreme importance. If not, I should much
        prefer to communicate with you alone.\u201D I rose to go, but Holmes caught
        me by the wrist and pushed me back into my chair. \u201CIt is both, or none,\u201D
        said he. \u201CYou may say before this gentleman anything which you may say
        to me.\u201D The Count shrugged his broad shoulders. \u201CThen I must begin,\u201D
        said he, \u201Cby binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years; at
        the end of that time the matter will be of no importance. At present it is
        not too much to say that it is of such weight it may have an influence upon
        European history.\u201D \u201CI promise,\u201D said Holmes. \u201CAnd I.\u201D
        \u201CYou will excuse this mask,\u201D continued our strange visitor. \u201CThe
        august person who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to you, and I
        may confess at once that the title by which I have just called myself is
        not exactly my own.\u201D \u201CI was aware of it,\u201D said Holmes dryly.
        \u201CThe circumstances are of great delicacy, and every precaution has to
        be taken to quench what might grow to be an immense scandal and seriously
        compromise one of the reigning families of Europe. To speak plainly, the
        matter implicates the great House of Ormstein, hereditary kings of Bohemia.\u201D
        \u201CI was also aware of that,\u201D murmured Holmes, settling himself down
        in his armchair and closing his eyes. Our visitor glanced with some apparent
        surprise at the languid, lounging figure of the man who had been no doubt
        depicted to him as the most incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in
        Europe. Holmes slowly reopened his eyes and looked impatiently at his gigantic
        client. \u201CIf your Majesty would condescend to state your case,\u201D
        he remarked, \u201CI should be better able to advise you.\u201D The man sprang
        from his chair and paced up and down the room in uncontrollable agitation.
        Then, with a gesture of desperation, he tore the mask from his face and hurled
        it upon the ground. \u201CYou are right,\u201D he cried; \u201CI am the King.
        Why should I attempt to conceal it?\u201D \u201CWhy, indeed?\u201D murmured
        Holmes. \u201CYour Majesty had not spoken before I was aware that I was addressing
        Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond von Ormstein, Grand Duke of Cassel-Felstein,
        and hereditary King of Bohemia.\u201D \u201CBut you can understand,\u201D
        said our strange visitor, sitting down once more and passing his hand over
        his high white forehead, \u201Cyou can understand that I am not accustomed
        to doing such business in my own person. Yet the matter was so delicate that
        I could not confide it to an agent without putting myself in his power. I
        have come incognito from Prague for the purpose of consulting you.\u201D
        \u201CThen, pray consult,\u201D said Holmes, shutting his eyes once more.
        \u201CThe facts are briefly these: Some five years ago, during a lengthy
        visit to Warsaw, I made the acquaintance of the well-known adventuress, Irene
        Adler. The name is no doubt familiar to you.\u201D \u201CKindly look her
        up in my index, Doctor,\u201D murmured Holmes without opening his eyes. For
        many years he had adopted a system of docketing all paragraphs concerning
        men and things, so that it was difficult to name a subject or a person on
        which he could not at once furnish information. In this case I found her
        biography sandwiched in between that of a Hebrew rabbi and that of a staff-commander
        who had written a monograph upon the deep-sea fishes. \u201CLet me see!\u201D
        said Holmes. \u201CHum! Born in New Jersey in the year 1858. Contralto\u2014hum!
        La Scala, hum! Prima donna Imperial Opera of Warsaw\u2014yes! Retired from
        operatic stage\u2014ha! Living in London\u2014quite so! Your Majesty, as
        I understand, became entangled with this young person, wrote her some compromising
        letters, and is now desirous of getting those letters back.\u201D \u201CPrecisely
        so. But how\u2014\u201D \u201CWas there a secret marriage?\u201D \u201CNone.\u201D
        \u201CNo legal papers or certificates?\u201D \u201CNone.\u201D \u201CThen
        I fail to follow your Majesty. If this young person should produce her letters
        for blackmailing or other purposes, how is she to prove their authenticity?\u201D
        \u201CThere is the writing.\u201D \u201CPooh, pooh! Forgery.\u201D \u201CMy
        private note-paper.\u201D \u201CStolen.\u201D \u201CMy own seal.\u201D \u201CImitated.\u201D
        \u201CMy photograph.\u201D \u201CBought.\u201D \u201CWe were both in the
        photograph.\u201D \u201COh, dear! That is very bad! Your Majesty has indeed
        committed an indiscretion.\u201D \u201CI was mad\u2014insane.\u201D \u201CYou
        have compromised yourself seriously.\u201D \u201CI was only Crown Prince
        then. I was young. I am but thirty now.\u201D \u201CIt must be recovered.\u201D
        \u201CWe have tried and failed.\u201D \u201CYour Majesty must pay. It must
        be bought.\u201D \u201CShe will not sell.\u201D \u201CStolen, then.\u201D
        \u201CFive attempts have been made. Twice burglars in my pay ransacked her
        house. Once we diverted her luggage when she travelled. Twice she has been
        waylaid. There has been no result.\u201D \u201CNo sign of it?\u201D \u201CAbsolutely
        none.\u201D Holmes laughed. \u201CIt is quite a pretty little problem,\u201D
        said he. \u201CBut a very serious one to me,\u201D returned the King reproachfully.
        \u201CVery, indeed. And what does she propose to do with the photograph?\u201D
        \u201CTo ruin me.\u201D \u201CBut how?\u201D \u201CI am about to be married.\u201D
        \u201CSo I have heard.\u201D \u201CTo Clotilde Lothman von Saxe-Meningen,
        second daughter of the King of Scandinavia. You may know the strict principles
        of her family. She is herself the very soul of delicacy. A shadow of a doubt
        as to my conduct would bring the matter to an end.\u201D \u201CAnd Irene
        Adler?\u201D \u201CThreatens to send them the photograph. And she will do
        it. I know that she will do it. You do not know her, but she has a soul of
        steel. She has the face of the most beautiful of women, and the mind of the
        most resolute of men. Rather than I should marry another woman, there are
        no lengths to which she would not go\u2014none.\u201D \u201CYou are sure
        that she has not sent it yet?\u201D \u201CI am sure.\u201D \u201CAnd why?\u201D
        \u201CBecause she has said that she would send it on the day when the betrothal
        was publicly proclaimed. That will be next Monday.\u201D \u201COh, then we
        have three days yet,\u201D said Holmes with a yawn. \u201CThat is very fortunate,
        as I have one or two matters of importance to look into just at present.
        Your Majesty will, of course, stay in London for the present?\u201D \u201CCertainly.
        You will find me at the Langham under the name of the Count Von Kramm.\u201D
        \u201CThen I shall drop you a line to let you know how we progress.\u201D
        \u201CPray do so. I shall be all anxiety.\u201D \u201CThen, as to money?\u201D
        \u201CYou have carte blanche.\u201D \u201CAbsolutely?\u201D \u201CI tell
        you that I would give one of the provinces of my kingdom to have that photograph.\u201D
        \u201CAnd for present expenses?\u201D The King took a heavy chamois leather
        bag from under his cloak and laid it on the table. \u201CThere are three
        hundred pounds in gold and seven hundred in notes,\u201D he said. Holmes
        scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his note-book and handed it to him. \u201CAnd
        Mademoiselle\u2019s address?\u201D he asked. \u201CIs Briony Lodge, Serpentine
        Avenue, St. John\u2019s Wood.\u201D Holmes took a note of it. \u201COne other
        question,\u201D said he. \u201CWas the photograph a cabinet?\u201D \u201CIt
        was.\u201D \u201CThen, good-night, your Majesty, and I trust that we shall
        soon have some good news for you. And good-night, Watson,\u201D he added,
        as the wheels of the royal brougham rolled down the street. \u201CIf you
        will be good enough to call to-morrow afternoon at three o\u2019clock I should
        like to chat this little matter over with you.\u201D"
