      value: "Saturday lives in my memory as a day of suspense. It was a day of lassitude
        too, hot and close, with, I am told, a rapidly fluctuating barometer. I had
        slept but little, though my wife had succeeded in sleeping, and I rose early.
        I went into my garden before breakfast and stood listening, but towards the
        common there was nothing stirring but a lark. The milkman came as usual.
        I heard the rattle of his chariot and I went round to the side gate to ask
        the latest news. He told me that during the night the Martians had been surrounded
        by troops, and that guns were expected. Then\u2014a familiar, reassuring
        note\u2014I heard a train running towards Woking. \u201CThey aren\u2019t
        to be killed,\u201D said the milkman, \u201Cif that can possibly be avoided.\u201D
        I saw my neighbour gardening, chatted with him for a time, and then strolled
        in to breakfast. It was a most unexceptional morning. My neighbour was of
        opinion that the troops would be able to capture or to destroy the Martians
        during the day. \u201CIt\u2019s a pity they make themselves so unapproachable,\u201D
        he said. \u201CIt would be curious to know how they live on another planet;
        we might learn a thing or two.\u201D He came up to the fence and extended
        a handful of strawberries, for his gardening was as generous as it was enthusiastic.
        At the same time he told me of the burning of the pine woods about the Byfleet
        Golf Links. \u201CThey say,\u201D said he, \u201Cthat there\u2019s another
        of those blessed things fallen there\u2014number two. But one\u2019s enough,
        surely. This lot\u2019ll cost the insurance people a pretty penny before
        everything\u2019s settled.\u201D He laughed with an air of the greatest good
        humour as he said this. The woods, he said, were still burning, and pointed
        out a haze of smoke to me. \u201CThey will be hot under foot for days, on
        account of the thick soil of pine needles and turf,\u201D he said, and then
        grew serious over \u201Cpoor Ogilvy.\u201D After breakfast, instead of working,
        I decided to walk down towards the common. Under the railway bridge I found
        a group of soldiers\u2014sappers, I think, men in small round caps, dirty
        red jackets unbuttoned, and showing their blue shirts, dark trousers, and
        boots coming to the calf. They told me no one was allowed over the canal,
        and, looking along the road towards the bridge, I saw one of the Cardigan
        men standing sentinel there. I talked with these soldiers for a time; I told
        them of my sight of the Martians on the previous evening. None of them had
        seen the Martians, and they had but the vaguest ideas of them, so that they
        plied me with questions. They said that they did not know who had authorised
        the movements of the troops; their idea was that a dispute had arisen at
        the Horse Guards. The ordinary sapper is a great deal better educated than
        the common soldier, and they discussed the peculiar conditions of the possible
        fight with some acuteness. I described the Heat-Ray to them, and they began
        to argue among themselves. \u201CCrawl up under cover and rush \u2019em,
        say I,\u201D said one. \u201CGet aht!\u201D said another. \u201CWhat\u2019s
        cover against this \u2019ere \u2019eat? Sticks to cook yer! What we got to
        do is to go as near as the ground\u2019ll let us, and then drive a trench.\u201D
        \u201CBlow yer trenches! You always want trenches; you ought to ha\u2019
        been born a rabbit Snippy.\u201D \u201CAin\u2019t they got any necks, then?\u201D
        said a third, abruptly\u2014a little, contemplative, dark man, smoking a
        pipe. I repeated my description. \u201COctopuses,\u201D said he, \u201Cthat\u2019s
        what I calls \u2019em. Talk about fishers of men\u2014fighters of fish it
        is this time!\u201D \u201CIt ain\u2019t no murder killing beasts like that,\u201D
        said the first speaker. \u201CWhy not shell the darned things strite off
        and finish \u2019em?\u201D said the little dark man. \u201CYou carn tell
        what they might do.\u201D \u201CWhere\u2019s your shells?\u201D said the
        first speaker. \u201CThere ain\u2019t no time. Do it in a rush, that\u2019s
        my tip, and do it at once.\u201D So they discussed it. After a while I left
        them, and went on to the railway station to get as many morning papers as
        I could. But I will not weary the reader with a description of that long
        morning and of the longer afternoon. I did not succeed in getting a glimpse
        of the common, for even Horsell and Chobham church towers were in the hands
        of the military authorities. The soldiers I addressed didn\u2019t know anything;
        the officers were mysterious as well as busy. I found people in the town
        quite secure again in the presence of the military, and I heard for the first
        time from Marshall, the tobacconist, that his son was among the dead on the
        common. The soldiers had made the people on the outskirts of Horsell lock
        up and leave their houses. I got back to lunch about two, very tired for,
        as I have said, the day was extremely hot and dull; and in order to refresh
        myself I took a cold bath in the afternoon. About half past four I went up
        to the railway station to get an evening paper, for the morning papers had
        contained only a very inaccurate description of the killing of Stent, Henderson,
        Ogilvy, and the others. But there was little I didn\u2019t know. The Martians
        did not show an inch of themselves. They seemed busy in their pit, and there
        was a sound of hammering and an almost continuous streamer of smoke. Apparently
        they were busy getting ready for a struggle. \u201CFresh attempts have been
        made to signal, but without success,\u201D was the stereotyped formula of
        the papers. A sapper told me it was done by a man in a ditch with a flag
        on a long pole. The Martians took as much notice of such advances as we should
        of the lowing of a cow. I must confess the sight of all this armament, all
        this preparation, greatly excited me. My imagination became belligerent,
        and defeated the invaders in a dozen striking ways; something of my schoolboy
        dreams of battle and heroism came back. It hardly seemed a fair fight to
        me at that time. They seemed very helpless in that pit of theirs. About three
        o\u2019clock there began the thud of a gun at measured intervals from Chertsey
        or Addlestone. I learned that the smouldering pine wood into which the second
        cylinder had fallen was being shelled, in the hope of destroying that object
        before it opened. It was only about five, however, that a field gun reached
        Chobham for use against the first body of Martians. About six in the evening,
        as I sat at tea with my wife in the summerhouse talking vigorously about
        the battle that was lowering upon us, I heard a muffled detonation from the
        common, and immediately after a gust of firing. Close on the heels of that
        came a violent rattling crash, quite close to us, that shook the ground;
        and, starting out upon the lawn, I saw the tops of the trees about the Oriental
        College burst into smoky red flame, and the tower of the little church beside
        it slide down into ruin. The pinnacle of the mosque had vanished, and the
        roof line of the college itself looked as if a hundred-ton gun had been at
        work upon it. One of our chimneys cracked as if a shot had hit it, flew,
        and a piece of it came clattering down the tiles and made a heap of broken
        red fragments upon the flower bed by my study window. I and my wife stood
        amazed. Then I realised that the crest of Maybury Hill must be within range
        of the Martians\u2019 Heat-Ray now that the college was cleared out of the
        way. At that I gripped my wife\u2019s arm, and without ceremony ran her out
        into the road. Then I fetched out the servant, telling her I would go upstairs
        myself for the box she was clamouring for. \u201CWe can\u2019t possibly stay
        here,\u201D I said; and as I spoke the firing reopened for a moment upon
        the common. \u201CBut where are we to go?\u201D said my wife in terror. I
        thought perplexed. Then I remembered her cousins at Leatherhead. \u201CLeatherhead!\u201D
        I shouted above the sudden noise. She looked away from me downhill. The people
        were coming out of their houses, astonished. \u201CHow are we to get to Leatherhead?\u201D
        she said. Down the hill I saw a bevy of hussars ride under the railway bridge;
        three galloped through the open gates of the Oriental College; two others
        dismounted, and began running from house to house. The sun, shining through
        the smoke that drove up from the tops of the trees, seemed blood red, and
        threw an unfamiliar lurid light upon everything. \u201CStop here,\u201D said
        I; \u201Cyou are safe here\u201D; and I started off at once for the Spotted
        Dog, for I knew the landlord had a horse and dog cart. I ran, for I perceived
        that in a moment everyone upon this side of the hill would be moving. I found
        him in his bar, quite unaware of what was going on behind his house. A man
        stood with his back to me, talking to him. \u201CI must have a pound,\u201D
        said the landlord, \u201Cand I\u2019ve no one to drive it.\u201D \u201CI\u2019ll
        give you two,\u201D said I, over the stranger\u2019s shoulder. \u201CWhat
        for?\u201D \u201CAnd I\u2019ll bring it back by midnight,\u201D I said. \u201CLord!\u201D
        said the landlord; \u201Cwhat\u2019s the hurry? I\u2019m selling my bit of
        a pig. Two pounds, and you bring it back? What\u2019s going on now?\u201D
        I explained hastily that I had to leave my home, and so secured the dog cart.
        At the time it did not seem to me nearly so urgent that the landlord should
        leave his. I took care to have the cart there and then, drove it off down
        the road, and, leaving it in charge of my wife and servant, rushed into my
        house and packed a few valuables, such plate as we had, and so forth. The
        beech trees below the house were burning while I did this, and the palings
        up the road glowed red. While I was occupied in this way, one of the dismounted
        hussars came running up. He was going from house to house, warning people
        to leave. He was going on as I came out of my front door, lugging my treasures,
        done up in a tablecloth. I shouted after him: \u201CWhat news?\u201D He turned,
        stared, bawled something about \u201Ccrawling out in a thing like a dish
        cover,\u201D and ran on to the gate of the house at the crest. A sudden whirl
        of black smoke driving across the road hid him for a moment. I ran to my
        neighbour\u2019s door and rapped to satisfy myself of what I already knew,
        that his wife had gone to London with him and had locked up their house.
        I went in again, according to my promise, to get my servant\u2019s box, lugged
        it out, clapped it beside her on the tail of the dog cart, and then caught
        the reins and jumped up into the driver\u2019s seat beside my wife. In another
        moment we were clear of the smoke and noise, and spanking down the opposite
        slope of Maybury Hill towards Old Woking. In front was a quiet sunny landscape,
        a wheat field ahead on either side of the road, and the Maybury Inn with
        its swinging sign. I saw the doctor\u2019s cart ahead of me. At the bottom
        of the hill I turned my head to look at the hillside I was leaving. Thick
        streamers of black smoke shot with threads of red fire were driving up into
        the still air, and throwing dark shadows upon the green treetops eastward.
        The smoke already extended far away to the east and west\u2014to the Byfleet
        pine woods eastward, and to Woking on the west. The road was dotted with
        people running towards us. And very faint now, but very distinct through
        the hot, quiet air, one heard the whirr of a machine-gun that was presently
        stilled, and an intermittent cracking of rifles. Apparently the Martians
        were setting fire to everything within range of their Heat-Ray. I am not
        an expert driver, and I had immediately to turn my attention to the horse.
        When I looked back again the second hill had hidden the black smoke. I slashed
        the horse with the whip, and gave him a loose rein until Woking and Send
        lay between us and that quivering tumult. I overtook and passed the doctor
        between Woking and Send."
