      value: "I spent that night in the inn that stands at the top of Putney Hill,
        sleeping in a made bed for the first time since my flight to Leatherhead.
        I will not tell the needless trouble I had breaking into that house\u2014afterwards
        I found the front door was on the latch\u2014nor how I ransacked every room
        for food, until just on the verge of despair, in what seemed to me to be
        a servant\u2019s bedroom, I found a rat-gnawed crust and two tins of pineapple.
        The place had been already searched and emptied. In the bar I afterwards
        found some biscuits and sandwiches that had been overlooked. The latter I
        could not eat, they were too rotten, but the former not only stayed my hunger,
        but filled my pockets. I lit no lamps, fearing some Martian might come beating
        that part of London for food in the night. Before I went to bed I had an
        interval of restlessness, and prowled from window to window, peering out
        for some sign of these monsters. I slept little. As I lay in bed I found
        myself thinking consecutively\u2014a thing I do not remember to have done
        since my last argument with the curate. During all the intervening time my
        mental condition had been a hurrying succession of vague emotional states
        or a sort of stupid receptivity. But in the night my brain, reinforced, I
        suppose, by the food I had eaten, grew clear again, and I thought. Three
        things struggled for possession of my mind: the killing of the curate, the
        whereabouts of the Martians, and the possible fate of my wife. The former
        gave me no sensation of horror or remorse to recall; I saw it simply as a
        thing done, a memory infinitely disagreeable but quite without the quality
        of remorse. I saw myself then as I see myself now, driven step by step towards
        that hasty blow, the creature of a sequence of accidents leading inevitably
        to that. I felt no condemnation; yet the memory, static, unprogressive, haunted
        me. In the silence of the night, with that sense of the nearness of God that
        sometimes comes into the stillness and the darkness, I stood my trial, my
        only trial, for that moment of wrath and fear. I retraced every step of our
        conversation from the moment when I had found him crouching beside me, heedless
        of my thirst, and pointing to the fire and smoke that streamed up from the
        ruins of Weybridge. We had been incapable of co-operation\u2014grim chance
        had taken no heed of that. Had I foreseen, I should have left him at Halliford.
        But I did not foresee; and crime is to foresee and do. And I set this down
        as I have set all this story down, as it was. There were no witnesses\u2014all
        these things I might have concealed. But I set it down, and the reader must
        form his judgment as he will. And when, by an effort, I had set aside that
        picture of a prostrate body, I faced the problem of the Martians and the
        fate of my wife. For the former I had no data; I could imagine a hundred
        things, and so, unhappily, I could for the latter. And suddenly that night
        became terrible. I found myself sitting up in bed, staring at the dark. I
        found myself praying that the Heat-Ray might have suddenly and painlessly
        struck her out of being. Since the night of my return from Leatherhead I
        had not prayed. I had uttered prayers, fetish prayers, had prayed as heathens
        mutter charms when I was in extremity; but now I prayed indeed, pleading
        steadfastly and sanely, face to face with the darkness of God. Strange night!
        Strangest in this, that so soon as dawn had come, I, who had talked with
        God, crept out of the house like a rat leaving its hiding place\u2014a creature
        scarcely larger, an inferior animal, a thing that for any passing whim of
        our masters might be hunted and killed. Perhaps they also prayed confidently
        to God. Surely, if we have learned nothing else, this war has taught us pity\u2014pity
        for those witless souls that suffer our dominion. The morning was bright
        and fine, and the eastern sky glowed pink, and was fretted with little golden
        clouds. In the road that runs from the top of Putney Hill to Wimbledon was
        a number of poor vestiges of the panic torrent that must have poured Londonward
        on the Sunday night after the fighting began. There was a little two-wheeled
        cart inscribed with the name of Thomas Lobb, Greengrocer, New Malden, with
        a smashed wheel and an abandoned tin trunk; there was a straw hat trampled
        into the now hardened mud, and at the top of West Hill a lot of blood-stained
        glass about the overturned water trough. My movements were languid, my plans
        of the vaguest. I had an idea of going to Leatherhead, though I knew that
        there I had the poorest chance of finding my wife. Certainly, unless death
        had overtaken them suddenly, my cousins and she would have fled thence; but
        it seemed to me I might find or learn there whither the Surrey people had
        fled. I knew I wanted to find my wife, that my heart ached for her and the
        world of men, but I had no clear idea how the finding might be done. I was
        also sharply aware now of my intense loneliness. From the corner I went,
        under cover of a thicket of trees and bushes, to the edge of Wimbledon Common,
        stretching wide and far. That dark expanse was lit in patches by yellow gorse
        and broom; there was no red weed to be seen, and as I prowled, hesitating,
        on the verge of the open, the sun rose, flooding it all with light and vitality.
        I came upon a busy swarm of little frogs in a swampy place among the trees.
        I stopped to look at them, drawing a lesson from their stout resolve to live.
        And presently, turning suddenly, with an odd feeling of being watched, I
        beheld something crouching amid a clump of bushes. I stood regarding this.
        I made a step towards it, and it rose up and became a man armed with a cutlass.
        I approached him slowly. He stood silent and motionless, regarding me. As
        I drew nearer I perceived he was dressed in clothes as dusty and filthy as
        my own; he looked, indeed, as though he had been dragged through a culvert.
        Nearer, I distinguished the green slime of ditches mixing with the pale drab
        of dried clay and shiny, coaly patches. His black hair fell over his eyes,
        and his face was dark and dirty and sunken, so that at first I did not recognise
        him. There was a red cut across the lower part of his face. \u201CStop!\u201D
        he cried, when I was within ten yards of him, and I stopped. His voice was
        hoarse. \u201CWhere do you come from?\u201D he said. I thought, surveying
        him. \u201CI come from Mortlake,\u201D I said. \u201CI was buried near the
        pit the Martians made about their cylinder. I have worked my way out and
        escaped.\u201D \u201CThere is no food about here,\u201D he said. \u201CThis
        is my country. All this hill down to the river, and back to Clapham, and
        up to the edge of the common. There is only food for one. Which way are you
        going?\u201D I answered slowly. \u201CI don\u2019t know,\u201D I said. \u201CI
        have been buried in the ruins of a house thirteen or fourteen days. I don\u2019t
        know what has happened.\u201D He looked at me doubtfully, then started, and
        looked with a changed expression. \u201CI\u2019ve no wish to stop about here,\u201D
        said I. \u201CI think I shall go to Leatherhead, for my wife was there.\u201D
        He shot out a pointing finger. \u201CIt is you,\u201D said he; \u201Cthe
        man from Woking. And you weren\u2019t killed at Weybridge?\u201D I recognised
        him at the same moment. \u201CYou are the artilleryman who came into my garden.\u201D
        \u201CGood luck!\u201D he said. \u201CWe are lucky ones! Fancy you!\u201D
        He put out a hand, and I took it. \u201CI crawled up a drain,\u201D he said.
        \u201CBut they didn\u2019t kill everyone. And after they went away I got
        off towards Walton across the fields. But\u2014\u2014 It\u2019s not sixteen
        days altogether\u2014and your hair is grey.\u201D He looked over his shoulder
        suddenly. \u201COnly a rook,\u201D he said. \u201COne gets to know that birds
        have shadows these days. This is a bit open. Let us crawl under those bushes
        and talk.\u201D \u201CHave you seen any Martians?\u201D I said. \u201CSince
        I crawled out\u2014\u2014\u201D \u201CThey\u2019ve gone away across London,\u201D
        he said. \u201CI guess they\u2019ve got a bigger camp there. Of a night,
        all over there, Hampstead way, the sky is alive with their lights. It\u2019s
        like a great city, and in the glare you can just see them moving. By daylight
        you can\u2019t. But nearer\u2014I haven\u2019t seen them\u2014\u201D (he
        counted on his fingers) \u201Cfive days. Then I saw a couple across Hammersmith
        way carrying something big. And the night before last\u201D\u2014he stopped
        and spoke impressively\u2014\u201Cit was just a matter of lights, but it
        was something up in the air. I believe they\u2019ve built a flying-machine,
        and are learning to fly.\u201D I stopped, on hands and knees, for we had
        come to the bushes. \u201CFly!\u201D \u201CYes,\u201D he said, \u201Cfly.\u201D
        I went on into a little bower, and sat down. \u201CIt is all over with humanity,\u201D
        I said. \u201CIf they can do that they will simply go round the world.\u201D
        He nodded. \u201CThey will. But\u2014\u2014 It will relieve things over here
        a bit. And besides\u2014\u2014\u201D He looked at me. \u201CAren\u2019t you
        satisfied it is up with humanity? I am. We\u2019re down; we\u2019re beat.\u201D
        I stared. Strange as it may seem, I had not arrived at this fact\u2014a fact
        perfectly obvious so soon as he spoke. I had still held a vague hope; rather,
        I had kept a lifelong habit of mind. He repeated his words, \u201CWe\u2019re
        beat.\u201D They carried absolute conviction. \u201CIt\u2019s all over,\u201D
        he said. \u201CThey\u2019ve lost one\u2014just one. And they\u2019ve made
        their footing good and crippled the greatest power in the world. They\u2019ve
        walked over us. The death of that one at Weybridge was an accident. And these
        are only pioneers. They kept on coming. These green stars\u2014I\u2019ve
        seen none these five or six days, but I\u2019ve no doubt they\u2019re falling
        somewhere every night. Nothing\u2019s to be done. We\u2019re under! We\u2019re
        beat!\u201D I made him no answer. I sat staring before me, trying in vain
        to devise some countervailing thought. \u201CThis isn\u2019t a war,\u201D
        said the artilleryman. \u201CIt never was a war, any more than there\u2019s
        war between man and ants.\u201D Suddenly I recalled the night in the observatory.
        \u201CAfter the tenth shot they fired no more\u2014at least, until the first
        cylinder came.\u201D \u201CHow do you know?\u201D said the artilleryman.
        I explained. He thought. \u201CSomething wrong with the gun,\u201D he said.
        \u201CBut what if there is? They\u2019ll get it right again. And even if
        there\u2019s a delay, how can it alter the end? It\u2019s just men and ants.
        There\u2019s the ants builds their cities, live their lives, have wars, revolutions,
        until the men want them out of the way, and then they go out of the way.
        That\u2019s what we are now\u2014just ants. Only\u2014\u2014\u201D \u201CYes,\u201D
        I said. \u201CWe\u2019re eatable ants.\u201D We sat looking at each other.
        \u201CAnd what will they do with us?\u201D I said. \u201CThat\u2019s what
        I\u2019ve been thinking,\u201D he said; \u201Cthat\u2019s what I\u2019ve
        been thinking. After Weybridge I went south\u2014thinking. I saw what was
        up. Most of the people were hard at it squealing and exciting themselves.
        But I\u2019m not so fond of squealing. I\u2019ve been in sight of death once
        or twice; I\u2019m not an ornamental soldier, and at the best and worst,
        death\u2014it\u2019s just death. And it\u2019s the man that keeps on thinking
        comes through. I saw everyone tracking away south. Says I, \u2018Food won\u2019t
        last this way,\u2019 and I turned right back. I went for the Martians like
        a sparrow goes for man. All round\u201D\u2014he waved a hand to the horizon\u2014\u201Cthey\u2019re
        starving in heaps, bolting, treading on each other. . . .\u201D He saw my
        face, and halted awkwardly. \u201CNo doubt lots who had money have gone away
        to France,\u201D he said. He seemed to hesitate whether to apologise, met
        my eyes, and went on: \u201CThere\u2019s food all about here. Canned things
        in shops; wines, spirits, mineral waters; and the water mains and drains
        are empty. Well, I was telling you what I was thinking. \u2018Here\u2019s
        intelligent things,\u2019 I said, \u2018and it seems they want us for food.
        First, they\u2019ll smash us up\u2014ships, machines, guns, cities, all the
        order and organisation. All that will go. If we were the size of ants we
        might pull through. But we\u2019re not. It\u2019s all too bulky to stop.
        That\u2019s the first certainty.\u2019 Eh?\u201D I assented. \u201CIt is;
        I\u2019ve thought it out. Very well, then\u2014next; at present we\u2019re
        caught as we\u2019re wanted. A Martian has only to go a few miles to get
        a crowd on the run. And I saw one, one day, out by Wandsworth, picking houses
        to pieces and routing among the wreckage. But they won\u2019t keep on doing
        that. So soon as they\u2019ve settled all our guns and ships, and smashed
        our railways, and done all the things they are doing over there, they will
        begin catching us systematic, picking the best and storing us in cages and
        things. That\u2019s what they will start doing in a bit. Lord! They haven\u2019t
        begun on us yet. Don\u2019t you see that?\u201D \u201CNot begun!\u201D I
        exclaimed. \u201CNot begun. All that\u2019s happened so far is through our
        not having the sense to keep quiet\u2014worrying them with guns and such
        foolery. And losing our heads, and rushing off in crowds to where there wasn\u2019t
        any more safety than where we were. They don\u2019t want to bother us yet.
        They\u2019re making their things\u2014making all the things they couldn\u2019t
        bring with them, getting things ready for the rest of their people. Very
        likely that\u2019s why the cylinders have stopped for a bit, for fear of
        hitting those who are here. And instead of our rushing about blind, on the
        howl, or getting dynamite on the chance of busting them up, we\u2019ve got
        to fix ourselves up according to the new state of affairs. That\u2019s how
        I figure it out. It isn\u2019t quite according to what a man wants for his
        species, but it\u2019s about what the facts point to. And that\u2019s the
        principle I acted upon. Cities, nations, civilisation, progress\u2014it\u2019s
        all over. That game\u2019s up. We\u2019re beat.\u201D \u201CBut if that is
        so, what is there to live for?\u201D The artilleryman looked at me for a
        moment. \u201CThere won\u2019t be any more blessed concerts for a million
        years or so; there won\u2019t be any Royal Academy of Arts, and no nice little
        feeds at restaurants. If it\u2019s amusement you\u2019re after, I reckon
        the game is up. If you\u2019ve got any drawing-room manners or a dislike
        to eating peas with a knife or dropping aitches, you\u2019d better chuck
        \u2019em away. They ain\u2019t no further use.\u201D \u201CYou mean\u2014\u2014\u201D
        \u201CI mean that men like me are going on living\u2014for the sake of the
        breed. I tell you, I\u2019m grim set on living. And if I\u2019m not mistaken,
        you\u2019ll show what insides you\u2019ve got, too, before long. We aren\u2019t
        going to be exterminated. And I don\u2019t mean to be caught either, and
        tamed and fattened and bred like a thundering ox. Ugh! Fancy those brown
        creepers!\u201D \u201CYou don\u2019t mean to say\u2014\u2014\u201D \u201CI
        do. I\u2019m going on, under their feet. I\u2019ve got it planned; I\u2019ve
        thought it out. We men are beat. We don\u2019t know enough. We\u2019ve got
        to learn before we\u2019ve got a chance. And we\u2019ve got to live and keep
        independent while we learn. See! That\u2019s what has to be done.\u201D I
        stared, astonished, and stirred profoundly by the man\u2019s resolution.
        \u201CGreat God!\u201D cried I. \u201CBut you are a man indeed!\u201D And
        suddenly I gripped his hand. \u201CEh!\u201D he said, with his eyes shining.
        \u201CI\u2019ve thought it out, eh?\u201D \u201CGo on,\u201D I said. \u201CWell,
        those who mean to escape their catching must get ready. I\u2019m getting
        ready. Mind you, it isn\u2019t all of us that are made for wild beasts; and
        that\u2019s what it\u2019s got to be. That\u2019s why I watched you. I had
        my doubts. You\u2019re slender. I didn\u2019t know that it was you, you see,
        or just how you\u2019d been buried. All these\u2014the sort of people that
        lived in these houses, and all those damn little clerks that used to live
        down that way\u2014they\u2019d be no good. They haven\u2019t any spirit in
        them\u2014no proud dreams and no proud lusts; and a man who hasn\u2019t one
        or the other\u2014Lord! What is he but funk and precautions? They just used
        to skedaddle off to work\u2014I\u2019ve seen hundreds of \u2019em, bit of
        breakfast in hand, running wild and shining to catch their little season-ticket
        train, for fear they\u2019d get dismissed if they didn\u2019t; working at
        businesses they were afraid to take the trouble to understand; skedaddling
        back for fear they wouldn\u2019t be in time for dinner; keeping indoors after
        dinner for fear of the back streets, and sleeping with the wives they married,
        not because they wanted them, but because they had a bit of money that would
        make for safety in their one little miserable skedaddle through the world.
        Lives insured and a bit invested for fear of accidents. And on Sundays\u2014fear
        of the hereafter. As if hell was built for rabbits! Well, the Martians will
        just be a godsend to these. Nice roomy cages, fattening food, careful breeding,
        no worry. After a week or so chasing about the fields and lands on empty
        stomachs, they\u2019ll come and be caught cheerful. They\u2019ll be quite
        glad after a bit. They\u2019ll wonder what people did before there were Martians
        to take care of them. And the bar loafers, and mashers, and singers\u2014I
        can imagine them. I can imagine them,\u201D he said, with a sort of sombre
        gratification. \u201CThere\u2019ll be any amount of sentiment and religion
        loose among them. There\u2019s hundreds of things I saw with my eyes that
        I\u2019ve only begun to see clearly these last few days. There\u2019s lots
        will take things as they are\u2014fat and stupid; and lots will be worried
        by a sort of feeling that it\u2019s all wrong, and that they ought to be
        doing something. Now whenever things are so that a lot of people feel they
        ought to be doing something, the weak, and those who go weak with a lot of
        complicated thinking, always make for a sort of do-nothing religion, very
        pious and superior, and submit to persecution and the will of the Lord. Very
        likely you\u2019ve seen the same thing. It\u2019s energy in a gale of funk,
        and turned clean inside out. These cages will be full of psalms and hymns
        and piety. And those of a less simple sort will work in a bit of\u2014what
        is it?\u2014eroticism.\u201D He paused. \u201CVery likely these Martians
        will make pets of some of them; train them to do tricks\u2014who knows?\u2014get
        sentimental over the pet boy who grew up and had to be killed. And some,
        maybe, they will train to hunt us.\u201D \u201CNo,\u201D I cried, \u201Cthat\u2019s
        impossible! No human being\u2014\u2014\u201D \u201CWhat\u2019s the good of
        going on with such lies?\u201D said the artilleryman. \u201CThere\u2019s
        men who\u2019d do it cheerful. What nonsense to pretend there isn\u2019t!\u201D
        And I succumbed to his conviction. \u201CIf they come after me,\u201D he
        said; \u201CLord, if they come after me!\u201D and subsided into a grim meditation.
        I sat contemplating these things. I could find nothing to bring against this
        man\u2019s reasoning. In the days before the invasion no one would have questioned
        my intellectual superiority to his\u2014I, a professed and recognised writer
        on philosophical themes, and he, a common soldier; and yet he had already
        formulated a situation that I had scarcely realised. \u201CWhat are you doing?\u201D
        I said presently. \u201CWhat plans have you made?\u201D He hesitated. \u201CWell,
        it\u2019s like this,\u201D he said. \u201CWhat have we to do? We have to
        invent a sort of life where men can live and breed, and be sufficiently secure
        to bring the children up. Yes\u2014wait a bit, and I\u2019ll make it clearer
        what I think ought to be done. The tame ones will go like all tame beasts;
        in a few generations they\u2019ll be big, beautiful, rich-blooded, stupid\u2014rubbish!
        The risk is that we who keep wild will go savage\u2014degenerate into a sort
        of big, savage rat. . . . You see, how I mean to live is underground. I\u2019ve
        been thinking about the drains. Of course those who don\u2019t know drains
        think horrible things; but under this London are miles and miles\u2014hundreds
        of miles\u2014and a few days rain and London empty will leave them sweet
        and clean. The main drains are big enough and airy enough for anyone. Then
        there\u2019s cellars, vaults, stores, from which bolting passages may be
        made to the drains. And the railway tunnels and subways. Eh? You begin to
        see? And we form a band\u2014able-bodied, clean-minded men. We\u2019re not
        going to pick up any rubbish that drifts in. Weaklings go out again.\u201D
        \u201CAs you meant me to go?\u201D \u201CWell\u2014I parleyed, didn\u2019t
        I?\u201D \u201CWe won\u2019t quarrel about that. Go on.\u201D \u201CThose
        who stop obey orders. Able-bodied, clean-minded women we want also\u2014mothers
        and teachers. No lackadaisical ladies\u2014no blasted rolling eyes. We can\u2019t
        have any weak or silly. Life is real again, and the useless and cumbersome
        and mischievous have to die. They ought to die. They ought to be willing
        to die. It\u2019s a sort of disloyalty, after all, to live and taint the
        race. And they can\u2019t be happy. Moreover, dying\u2019s none so dreadful;
        it\u2019s the funking makes it bad. And in all those places we shall gather.
        Our district will be London. And we may even be able to keep a watch, and
        run about in the open when the Martians keep away. Play cricket, perhaps.
        That\u2019s how we shall save the race. Eh? It\u2019s a possible thing? But
        saving the race is nothing in itself. As I say, that\u2019s only being rats.
        It\u2019s saving our knowledge and adding to it is the thing. There men like
        you come in. There\u2019s books, there\u2019s models. We must make great
        safe places down deep, and get all the books we can; not novels and poetry
        swipes, but ideas, science books. That\u2019s where men like you come in.
        We must go to the British Museum and pick all those books through. Especially
        we must keep up our science\u2014learn more. We must watch these Martians.
        Some of us must go as spies. When it\u2019s all working, perhaps I will.
        Get caught, I mean. And the great thing is, we must leave the Martians alone.
        We mustn\u2019t even steal. If we get in their way, we clear out. We must
        show them we mean no harm. Yes, I know. But they\u2019re intelligent things,
        and they won\u2019t hunt us down if they have all they want, and think we\u2019re
        just harmless vermin.\u201D The artilleryman paused and laid a brown hand
        upon my arm. \u201CAfter all, it may not be so much we may have to learn
        before\u2014Just imagine this: four or five of their fighting machines suddenly
        starting off\u2014Heat-Rays right and left, and not a Martian in \u2019em.
        Not a Martian in \u2019em, but men\u2014men who have learned the way how.
        It may be in my time, even\u2014those men. Fancy having one of them lovely
        things, with its Heat-Ray wide and free! Fancy having it in control! What
        would it matter if you smashed to smithereens at the end of the run, after
        a bust like that? I reckon the Martians\u2019ll open their beautiful eyes!
        Can\u2019t you see them, man? Can\u2019t you see them hurrying, hurrying\u2014puffing
        and blowing and hooting to their other mechanical affairs? Something out
        of gear in every case. And swish, bang, rattle, swish! Just as they are fumbling
        over it, swish comes the Heat-Ray, and, behold! man has come back to his
        own.\u201D For a while the imaginative daring of the artilleryman, and the
        tone of assurance and courage he assumed, completely dominated my mind. I
        believed unhesitatingly both in his forecast of human destiny and in the
        practicability of his astonishing scheme, and the reader who thinks me susceptible
        and foolish must contrast his position, reading steadily with all his thoughts
        about his subject, and mine, crouching fearfully in the bushes and listening,
        distracted by apprehension. We talked in this manner through the early morning
        time, and later crept out of the bushes, and, after scanning the sky for
        Martians, hurried precipitately to the house on Putney Hill where he had
        made his lair. It was the coal cellar of the place, and when I saw the work
        he had spent a week upon\u2014it was a burrow scarcely ten yards long, which
        he designed to reach to the main drain on Putney Hill\u2014I had my first
        inkling of the gulf between his dreams and his powers. Such a hole I could
        have dug in a day. But I believed in him sufficiently to work with him all
        that morning until past midday at his digging. We had a garden barrow and
        shot the earth we removed against the kitchen range. We refreshed ourselves
        with a tin of mock-turtle soup and wine from the neighbouring pantry. I found
        a curious relief from the aching strangeness of the world in this steady
        labour. As we worked, I turned his project over in my mind, and presently
        objections and doubts began to arise; but I worked there all the morning,
        so glad was I to find myself with a purpose again. After working an hour
        I began to speculate on the distance one had to go before the cloaca was
        reached, the chances we had of missing it altogether. My immediate trouble
        was why we should dig this long tunnel, when it was possible to get into
        the drain at once down one of the manholes, and work back to the house. It
        seemed to me, too, that the house was inconveniently chosen, and required
        a needless length of tunnel. And just as I was beginning to face these things,
        the artilleryman stopped digging, and looked at me. \u201CWe\u2019re working
        well,\u201D he said. He put down his spade. \u201CLet us knock off a bit\u201D
        he said. \u201CI think it\u2019s time we reconnoitred from the roof of the
        house.\u201D I was for going on, and after a little hesitation he resumed
        his spade; and then suddenly I was struck by a thought. I stopped, and so
        did he at once. \u201CWhy were you walking about the common,\u201D I said,
        \u201Cinstead of being here?\u201D \u201CTaking the air,\u201D he said. \u201CI
        was coming back. It\u2019s safer by night.\u201D \u201CBut the work?\u201D
        \u201COh, one can\u2019t always work,\u201D he said, and in a flash I saw
        the man plain. He hesitated, holding his spade. \u201CWe ought to reconnoitre
        now,\u201D he said, \u201Cbecause if any come near they may hear the spades
        and drop upon us unawares.\u201D I was no longer disposed to object. We went
        together to the roof and stood on a ladder peeping out of the roof door.
        No Martians were to be seen, and we ventured out on the tiles, and slipped
        down under shelter of the parapet. From this position a shrubbery hid the
        greater portion of Putney, but we could see the river below, a bubbly mass
        of red weed, and the low parts of Lambeth flooded and red. The red creeper
        swarmed up the trees about the old palace, and their branches stretched gaunt
        and dead, and set with shrivelled leaves, from amid its clusters. It was
        strange how entirely dependent both these things were upon flowing water
        for their propagation. About us neither had gained a footing; laburnums,
        pink mays, snowballs, and trees of arbor-vitae, rose out of laurels and hydrangeas,
        green and brilliant into the sunlight. Beyond Kensington dense smoke was
        rising, and that and a blue haze hid the northward hills. The artilleryman
        began to tell me of the sort of people who still remained in London. \u201COne
        night last week,\u201D he said, \u201Csome fools got the electric light in
        order, and there was all Regent Street and the Circus ablaze, crowded with
        painted and ragged drunkards, men and women, dancing and shouting till dawn.
        A man who was there told me. And as the day came they became aware of a fighting-machine
        standing near by the Langham and looking down at them. Heaven knows how long
        he had been there. It must have given some of them a nasty turn. He came
        down the road towards them, and picked up nearly a hundred too drunk or frightened
        to run away.\u201D Grotesque gleam of a time no history will ever fully describe!
        From that, in answer to my questions, he came round to his grandiose plans
        again. He grew enthusiastic. He talked so eloquently of the possibility of
        capturing a fighting-machine that I more than half believed in him again.
        But now that I was beginning to understand something of his quality, I could
        divine the stress he laid on doing nothing precipitately. And I noted that
        now there was no question that he personally was to capture and fight the
        great machine. After a time we went down to the cellar. Neither of us seemed
        disposed to resume digging, and when he suggested a meal, I was nothing loath.
        He became suddenly very generous, and when we had eaten he went away and
        returned with some excellent cigars. We lit these, and his optimism glowed.
        He was inclined to regard my coming as a great occasion. \u201CThere\u2019s
        some champagne in the cellar,\u201D he said. \u201CWe can dig better on this
        Thames-side burgundy,\u201D said I. \u201CNo,\u201D said he; \u201CI am host
        today. Champagne! Great God! We\u2019ve a heavy enough task before us! Let
        us take a rest and gather strength while we may. Look at these blistered
        hands!\u201D And pursuant to this idea of a holiday, he insisted upon playing
        cards after we had eaten. He taught me euchre, and after dividing London
        between us, I taking the northern side and he the southern, we played for
        parish points. Grotesque and foolish as this will seem to the sober reader,
        it is absolutely true, and what is more remarkable, I found the card game
        and several others we played extremely interesting. Strange mind of man!
        that, with our species upon the edge of extermination or appalling degradation,
        with no clear prospect before us but the chance of a horrible death, we could
        sit following the chance of this painted pasteboard, and playing the \u201Cjoker\u201D
        with vivid delight. Afterwards he taught me poker, and I beat him at three
        tough chess games. When dark came we decided to take the risk, and lit a
        lamp. After an interminable string of games, we supped, and the artilleryman
        finished the champagne. We went on smoking the cigars. He was no longer the
        energetic regenerator of his species I had encountered in the morning. He
        was still optimistic, but it was a less kinetic, a more thoughtful optimism.
        I remember he wound up with my health, proposed in a speech of small variety
        and considerable intermittence. I took a cigar, and went upstairs to look
        at the lights of which he had spoken that blazed so greenly along the Highgate
        hills. At first I stared unintelligently across the London valley. The northern
        hills were shrouded in darkness; the fires near Kensington glowed redly,
        and now and then an orange-red tongue of flame flashed up and vanished in
        the deep blue night. All the rest of London was black. Then, nearer, I perceived
        a strange light, a pale, violet-purple fluorescent glow, quivering under
        the night breeze. For a space I could not understand it, and then I knew
        that it must be the red weed from which this faint irradiation proceeded.
        With that realisation my dormant sense of wonder, my sense of the proportion
        of things, awoke again. I glanced from that to Mars, red and clear, glowing
        high in the west, and then gazed long and earnestly at the darkness of Hampstead
        and Highgate. I remained a very long time upon the roof, wondering at the
        grotesque changes of the day. I recalled my mental states from the midnight
        prayer to the foolish card-playing. I had a violent revulsion of feeling.
        I remember I flung away the cigar with a certain wasteful symbolism. My folly
        came to me with glaring exaggeration. I seemed a traitor to my wife and to
        my kind; I was filled with remorse. I resolved to leave this strange undisciplined
        dreamer of great things to his drink and gluttony, and to go on into London.
        There, it seemed to me, I had the best chance of learning what the Martians
        and my fellowmen were doing. I was still upon the roof when the late moon
        rose. "
