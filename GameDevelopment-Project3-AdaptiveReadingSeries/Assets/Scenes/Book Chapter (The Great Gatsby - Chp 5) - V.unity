      value: "When I came home to West Egg that night I was afraid for a moment that
        my house was on fire. Two o\u2019clock and the whole corner of the peninsula
        was blazing with light, which fell unreal on the shrubbery and made thin
        elongating glints upon the roadside wires. Turning a corner, I saw that it
        was Gatsby\u2019s house, lit from tower to cellar. At first I thought it
        was another party, a wild rout that had resolved itself into \u201Chide-and-go-seek\u201D
        or \u201Csardines-in-the-box\u201D with all the house thrown open to the
        game. But there wasn\u2019t a sound. Only wind in the trees, which blew the
        wires and made the lights go off and on again as if the house had winked
        into the darkness. As my taxi groaned away I saw Gatsby walking toward me
        across his lawn. \u201CYour place looks like the World\u2019s Fair,\u201D
        I said. \u201CDoes it?\u201D He turned his eyes toward it absently. \u201CI
        have been glancing into some of the rooms. Let\u2019s go to Coney Island,
        old sport. In my car.\u201D \u201CIt\u2019s too late.\u201D \u201CWell, suppose
        we take a plunge in the swimming pool? I haven\u2019t made use of it all
        summer.\u201D \u201CI\u2019ve got to go to bed.\u201D \u201CAll right.\u201D
        He waited, looking at me with suppressed eagerness. \u201CI talked with Miss
        Baker,\u201D I said after a moment. \u201CI\u2019m going to call up Daisy
        tomorrow and invite her over here to tea.\u201D \u201COh, that\u2019s all
        right,\u201D he said carelessly. \u201CI don\u2019t want to put you to any
        trouble.\u201D \u201CWhat day would suit you?\u201D \u201CWhat day would
        suit you?\u201D he corrected me quickly. \u201CI don\u2019t want to put you
        to any trouble, you see.\u201D \u201CHow about the day after tomorrow?\u201D
        He considered for a moment. Then, with reluctance: \u201CI want to get the
        grass cut,\u201D he said. We both looked down at the grass\u2014there was
        a sharp line where my ragged lawn ended and the darker, well-kept expanse
        of his began. I suspected that he meant my grass. \u201CThere\u2019s another
        little thing,\u201D he said uncertainly, and hesitated. \u201CWould you rather
        put it off for a few days?\u201D I asked. \u201COh, it isn\u2019t about that.
        At least\u2014\u201D He fumbled with a series of beginnings. \u201CWhy, I
        thought\u2014why, look here, old sport, you don\u2019t make much money, do
        you?\u201D \u201CNot very much.\u201D This seemed to reassure him and he
        continued more confidently. \u201CI thought you didn\u2019t, if you\u2019ll
        pardon my\u2014you see, I carry on a little business on the side, a sort
        of side line, you understand. And I thought that if you don\u2019t make very
        much\u2014You\u2019re selling bonds, aren\u2019t you, old sport?\u201D \u201CTrying
        to.\u201D \u201CWell, this would interest you. It wouldn\u2019t take up much
        of your time and you might pick up a nice bit of money. It happens to be
        a rather confidential sort of thing.\u201D I realize now that under different
        circumstances that conversation might have been one of the crises of my life.
        But, because the offer was obviously and tactlessly for a service to be rendered,
        I had no choice except to cut him off there. \u201CI\u2019ve got my hands
        full,\u201D I said. \u201CI\u2019m much obliged but I couldn\u2019t take
        on any more work.\u201D \u201CYou wouldn\u2019t have to do any business with
        Wolfshiem.\u201D Evidently he thought that I was shying away from the \u201Cgonnegtion\u201D
        mentioned at lunch, but I assured him he was wrong. He waited a moment longer,
        hoping I\u2019d begin a conversation, but I was too absorbed to be responsive,
        so he went unwillingly home. The evening had made me lightheaded and happy;
        I think I walked into a deep sleep as I entered my front door. So I don\u2019t
        know whether or not Gatsby went to Coney Island, or for how many hours he
        \u201Cglanced into rooms\u201D while his house blazed gaudily on. I called
        up Daisy from the office next morning, and invited her to come to tea. \u201CDon\u2019t
        bring Tom,\u201D I warned her. \u201CWhat?\u201D \u201CDon\u2019t bring Tom.\u201D
        \u201CWho is \u2018Tom\u2019?\u201D she asked innocently. The day agreed
        upon was pouring rain. At eleven o\u2019clock a man in a raincoat, dragging
        a lawn-mower, tapped at my front door and said that Mr. Gatsby had sent him
        over to cut my grass. This reminded me that I had forgotten to tell my Finn
        to come back, so I drove into West Egg Village to search for her among soggy
        whitewashed alleys and to buy some cups and lemons and flowers. The flowers
        were unnecessary, for at two o\u2019clock a greenhouse arrived from Gatsby\u2019s,
        with innumerable receptacles to contain it. An hour later the front door
        opened nervously, and Gatsby in a white flannel suit, silver shirt, and gold-coloured
        tie, hurried in. He was pale, and there were dark signs of sleeplessness
        beneath his eyes. \u201CIs everything all right?\u201D he asked immediately.
        \u201CThe grass looks fine, if that\u2019s what you mean.\u201D \u201CWhat
        grass?\u201D he inquired blankly. \u201COh, the grass in the yard.\u201D
        He looked out the window at it, but, judging from his expression, I don\u2019t
        believe he saw a thing. \u201CLooks very good,\u201D he remarked vaguely.
        \u201COne of the papers said they thought the rain would stop about four.
        I think it was The Journal. Have you got everything you need in the shape
        of\u2014of tea?\u201D I took him into the pantry, where he looked a little
        reproachfully at the Finn. Together we scrutinized the twelve lemon cakes
        from the delicatessen shop. \u201CWill they do?\u201D I asked. \u201COf course,
        of course! They\u2019re fine!\u201D and he added hollowly, \u201C\u2026 old
        sport.\u201D The rain cooled about half-past three to a damp mist, through
        which occasional thin drops swam like dew. Gatsby looked with vacant eyes
        through a copy of Clay\u2019s Economics, starting at the Finnish tread that
        shook the kitchen floor, and peering towards the bleared windows from time
        to time as if a series of invisible but alarming happenings were taking place
        outside. Finally he got up and informed me, in an uncertain voice, that he
        was going home. \u201CWhy\u2019s that?\u201D \u201CNobody\u2019s coming to
        tea. It\u2019s too late!\u201D He looked at his watch as if there was some
        pressing demand on his time elsewhere. \u201CI can\u2019t wait all day.\u201D
        \u201CDon\u2019t be silly; it\u2019s just two minutes to four.\u201D He sat
        down miserably, as if I had pushed him, and simultaneously there was the
        sound of a motor turning into my lane. We both jumped up, and, a little harrowed
        myself, I went out into the yard. Under the dripping bare lilac-trees a large
        open car was coming up the drive. It stopped. Daisy\u2019s face, tipped sideways
        beneath a three-cornered lavender hat, looked out at me with a bright ecstatic
        smile. \u201CIs this absolutely where you live, my dearest one?\u201D The
        exhilarating ripple of her voice was a wild tonic in the rain. I had to follow
        the sound of it for a moment, up and down, with my ear alone, before any
        words came through. A damp streak of hair lay like a dash of blue paint across
        her cheek, and her hand was wet with glistening drops as I took it to help
        her from the car. \u201CAre you in love with me,\u201D she said low in my
        ear, \u201Cor why did I have to come alone?\u201D \u201CThat\u2019s the secret
        of Castle Rackrent. Tell your chauffeur to go far away and spend an hour.\u201D
        \u201CCome back in an hour, Ferdie.\u201D Then in a grave murmur: \u201CHis
        name is Ferdie.\u201D \u201CDoes the gasoline affect his nose?\u201D \u201CI
        don\u2019t think so,\u201D she said innocently. \u201CWhy?\u201D We went
        in. To my overwhelming surprise the living-room was deserted. \u201CWell,
        that\u2019s funny,\u201D I exclaimed. \u201CWhat\u2019s funny?\u201D She
        turned her head as there was a light dignified knocking at the front door.
        I went out and opened it. Gatsby, pale as death, with his hands plunged like
        weights in his coat pockets, was standing in a puddle of water glaring tragically
        into my eyes. With his hands still in his coat pockets he stalked by me into
        the hall, turned sharply as if he were on a wire, and disappeared into the
        living-room. It wasn\u2019t a bit funny. Aware of the loud beating of my
        own heart I pulled the door to against the increasing rain. For half a minute
        there wasn\u2019t a sound. Then from the living-room I heard a sort of choking
        murmur and part of a laugh, followed by Daisy\u2019s voice on a clear artificial
        note: \u201CI certainly am awfully glad to see you again.\u201D A pause;
        it endured horribly. I had nothing to do in the hall, so I went into the
        room. Gatsby, his hands still in his pockets, was reclining against the mantelpiece
        in a strained counterfeit of perfect ease, even of boredom. His head leaned
        back so far that it rested against the face of a defunct mantelpiece clock,
        and from this position his distraught eyes stared down at Daisy, who was
        sitting, frightened but graceful, on the edge of a stiff chair. \u201CWe\u2019ve
        met before,\u201D muttered Gatsby. His eyes glanced momentarily at me, and
        his lips parted with an abortive attempt at a laugh. Luckily the clock took
        this moment to tilt dangerously at the pressure of his head, whereupon he
        turned and caught it with trembling fingers, and set it back in place. Then
        he sat down, rigidly, his elbow on the arm of the sofa and his chin in his
        hand. \u201CI\u2019m sorry about the clock,\u201D he said. My own face had
        now assumed a deep tropical burn. I couldn\u2019t muster up a single commonplace
        out of the thousand in my head. \u201CIt\u2019s an old clock,\u201D I told
        them idiotically. I think we all believed for a moment that it had smashed
        in pieces on the floor. \u201CWe haven\u2019t met for many years,\u201D said
        Daisy, her voice as matter-of-fact as it could ever be. \u201CFive years
        next November.\u201D The automatic quality of Gatsby\u2019s answer set us
        all back at least another minute. I had them both on their feet with the
        desperate suggestion that they help me make tea in the kitchen when the demoniac
        Finn brought it in on a tray. Amid the welcome confusion of cups and cakes
        a certain physical decency established itself. Gatsby got himself into a
        shadow and, while Daisy and I talked, looked conscientiously from one to
        the other of us with tense, unhappy eyes. However, as calmness wasn\u2019t
        an end in itself, I made an excuse at the first possible moment, and got
        to my feet. \u201CWhere are you going?\u201D demanded Gatsby in immediate
        alarm. \u201CI\u2019ll be back.\u201D \u201CI\u2019ve got to speak to you
        about something before you go.\u201D He followed me wildly into the kitchen,
        closed the door, and whispered: \u201COh, God!\u201D in a miserable way.
        \u201CWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201D \u201CThis is a terrible mistake,\u201D
        he said, shaking his head from side to side, \u201Ca terrible, terrible mistake.\u201D
        \u201CYou\u2019re just embarrassed, that\u2019s all,\u201D and luckily I
        added: \u201CDaisy\u2019s embarrassed too.\u201D \u201CShe\u2019s embarrassed?\u201D
        he repeated incredulously. \u201CJust as much as you are.\u201D \u201CDon\u2019t
        talk so loud.\u201D \u201CYou\u2019re acting like a little boy,\u201D I broke
        out impatiently. \u201CNot only that, but you\u2019re rude. Daisy\u2019s
        sitting in there all alone.\u201D He raised his hand to stop my words, looked
        at me with unforgettable reproach, and, opening the door cautiously, went
        back into the other room. I walked out the back way\u2014just as Gatsby had
        when he had made his nervous circuit of the house half an hour before\u2014and
        ran for a huge black knotted tree, whose massed leaves made a fabric against
        the rain. Once more it was pouring, and my irregular lawn, well-shaved by
        Gatsby\u2019s gardener, abounded in small muddy swamps and prehistoric marshes.
        There was nothing to look at from under the tree except Gatsby\u2019s enormous
        house, so I stared at it, like Kant at his church steeple, for half an hour.
        A brewer had built it early in the \u201Cperiod\u201D craze, a decade before,
        and there was a story that he\u2019d agreed to pay five years\u2019 taxes
        on all the neighbouring cottages if the owners would have their roofs thatched
        with straw. Perhaps their refusal took the heart out of his plan to Found
        a Family\u2014he went into an immediate decline. His children sold his house
        with the black wreath still on the door. Americans, while willing, even eager,
        to be serfs, have always been obstinate about being peasantry. After half
        an hour, the sun shone again, and the grocer\u2019s automobile rounded Gatsby\u2019s
        drive with the raw material for his servants\u2019 dinner\u2014I felt sure
        he wouldn\u2019t eat a spoonful. A maid began opening the upper windows of
        his house, appeared momentarily in each, and, leaning from the large central
        bay, spat meditatively into the garden. It was time I went back. While the
        rain continued it had seemed like the murmur of their voices, rising and
        swelling a little now and then with gusts of emotion. But in the new silence
        I felt that silence had fallen within the house too. I went in\u2014after
        making every possible noise in the kitchen, short of pushing over the stove\u2014but
        I don\u2019t believe they heard a sound. They were sitting at either end
        of the couch, looking at each other as if some question had been asked, or
        was in the air, and every vestige of embarrassment was gone. Daisy\u2019s
        face was smeared with tears, and when I came in she jumped up and began wiping
        at it with her handkerchief before a mirror. But there was a change in Gatsby
        that was simply confounding. He literally glowed; without a word or a gesture
        of exultation a new well-being radiated from him and filled the little room.
        \u201COh, hello, old sport,\u201D he said, as if he hadn\u2019t seen me for
        years. I thought for a moment he was going to shake hands. \u201CIt\u2019s
        stopped raining.\u201D \u201CHas it?\u201D When he realized what I was talking
        about, that there were twinkle-bells of sunshine in the room, he smiled like
        a weather man, like an ecstatic patron of recurrent light, and repeated the
        news to Daisy. \u201CWhat do you think of that? It\u2019s stopped raining.\u201D
        \u201CI\u2019m glad, Jay.\u201D Her throat, full of aching, grieving beauty,
        told only of her unexpected joy. \u201CI want you and Daisy to come over
        to my house,\u201D he said, \u201CI\u2019d like to show her around.\u201D
        \u201CYou\u2019re sure you want me to come?\u201D \u201CAbsolutely, old sport.\u201D
        Daisy went upstairs to wash her face\u2014too late I thought with humiliation
        of my towels\u2014while Gatsby and I waited on the lawn. \u201CMy house looks
        well, doesn\u2019t it?\u201D he demanded. \u201CSee how the whole front of
        it catches the light.\u201D I agreed that it was splendid. \u201CYes.\u201D
        His eyes went over it, every arched door and square tower. \u201CIt took
        me just three years to earn the money that bought it.\u201D \u201CI thought
        you inherited your money.\u201D \u201CI did, old sport,\u201D he said automatically,
        \u201Cbut I lost most of it in the big panic\u2014the panic of the war.\u201D
        I think he hardly knew what he was saying, for when I asked him what business
        he was in he answered: \u201CThat\u2019s my affair,\u201D before he realized
        that it wasn\u2019t an appropriate reply. \u201COh, I\u2019ve been in several
        things,\u201D he corrected himself. \u201CI was in the drug business and
        then I was in the oil business. But I\u2019m not in either one now.\u201D
        He looked at me with more attention. \u201CDo you mean you\u2019ve been thinking
        over what I proposed the other night?\u201D Before I could answer, Daisy
        came out of the house and two rows of brass buttons on her dress gleamed
        in the sunlight. \u201CThat huge place there?\u201D she cried pointing. \u201CDo
        you like it?\u201D \u201CI love it, but I don\u2019t see how you live there
        all alone.\u201D \u201CI keep it always full of interesting people, night
        and day. People who do interesting things. Celebrated people.\u201D Instead
        of taking the shortcut along the Sound we went down to the road and entered
        by the big postern. With enchanting murmurs Daisy admired this aspect or
        that of the feudal silhouette against the sky, admired the gardens, the sparkling
        odour of jonquils and the frothy odour of hawthorn and plum blossoms and
        the pale gold odour of kiss-me-at-the-gate. It was strange to reach the marble
        steps and find no stir of bright dresses in and out the door, and hear no
        sound but bird voices in the trees. And inside, as we wandered through Marie
        Antoinette music-rooms and Restoration Salons, I felt that there were guests
        concealed behind every couch and table, under orders to be breathlessly silent
        until we had passed through. As Gatsby closed the door of \u201Cthe Merton
        College Library\u201D I could have sworn I heard the owl-eyed man break into
        ghostly laughter. We went upstairs, through period bedrooms swathed in rose
        and lavender silk and vivid with new flowers, through dressing-rooms and
        poolrooms, and bathrooms with sunken baths\u2014intruding into one chamber
        where a dishevelled man in pyjamas was doing liver exercises on the floor.
        It was Mr. Klipspringer, the \u201Cboarder.\u201D I had seen him wandering
        hungrily about the beach that morning. Finally we came to Gatsby\u2019s own
        apartment, a bedroom and a bath, and an Adam\u2019s study, where we sat down
        and drank a glass of some Chartreuse he took from a cupboard in the wall.
        He hadn\u2019t once ceased looking at Daisy, and I think he revalued everything
        in his house according to the measure of response it drew from her well-loved
        eyes. Sometimes too, he stared around at his possessions in a dazed way,
        as though in her actual and astounding presence none of it was any longer
        real. Once he nearly toppled down a flight of stairs. His bedroom was the
        simplest room of all\u2014except where the dresser was garnished with a toilet
        set of pure dull gold. Daisy took the brush with delight, and smoothed her
        hair, whereupon Gatsby sat down and shaded his eyes and began to laugh. \u201CIt\u2019s
        the funniest thing, old sport,\u201D he said hilariously. \u201CI can\u2019t\u2014When
        I try to\u2014\u201D He had passed visibly through two states and was entering
        upon a third. After his embarrassment and his unreasoning joy he was consumed
        with wonder at her presence. He had been full of the idea so long, dreamed
        it right through to the end, waited with his teeth set, so to speak, at an
        inconceivable pitch of intensity. Now, in the reaction, he was running down
        like an over-wound clock. Recovering himself in a minute he opened for us
        two hulking patent cabinets which held his massed suits and dressing-gowns
        and ties, and his shirts, piled like bricks in stacks a dozen high. \u201CI\u2019ve
        got a man in England who buys me clothes. He sends over a selection of things
        at the beginning of each season, spring and fall.\u201D He took out a pile
        of shirts and began throwing them, one by one, before us, shirts of sheer
        linen and thick silk and fine flannel, which lost their folds as they fell
        and covered the table in many-coloured disarray. While we admired he brought
        more and the soft rich heap mounted higher\u2014shirts with stripes and scrolls
        and plaids in coral and apple-green and lavender and faint orange, with monograms
        of indian blue. Suddenly, with a strained sound, Daisy bent her head into
        the shirts and began to cry stormily. \u201CThey\u2019re such beautiful shirts,\u201D
        she sobbed, her voice muffled in the thick folds. \u201CIt makes me sad because
        I\u2019ve never seen such\u2014such beautiful shirts before.\u201D **********After
        the house, we were to see the grounds and the swimming pool, and the hydroplane,
        and the midsummer flowers\u2014but outside Gatsby\u2019s window it began
        to rain again, so we stood in a row looking at the corrugated surface of
        the Sound. \u201CIf it wasn\u2019t for the mist we could see your home across
        the bay,\u201D said Gatsby. \u201CYou always have a green light that burns
        all night at the end of your dock.\u201D Daisy put her arm through his abruptly,
        but he seemed absorbed in what he had just said. Possibly it had occurred
        to him that the colossal significance of that light had now vanished forever.
        Compared to the great distance that had separated him from Daisy it had seemed
        very near to her, almost touching her. It had seemed as close as a star to
        the moon. Now it was again a green light on a dock. His count of enchanted
        objects had diminished by one. I began to walk about the room, examining
        various indefinite objects in the half darkness. A large photograph of an
        elderly man in yachting costume attracted me, hung on the wall over his desk.
        \u201CWho\u2019s this?\u201D \u201CThat? That\u2019s Mr. Dan Cody, old sport.\u201D
        The name sounded faintly familiar. \u201CHe\u2019s dead now. He used to be
        my best friend years ago.\u201D There was a small picture of Gatsby, also
        in yachting costume, on the bureau\u2014Gatsby with his head thrown back
        defiantly\u2014taken apparently when he was about eighteen. \u201CI adore
        it,\u201D exclaimed Daisy. \u201CThe pompadour! You never told me you had
        a pompadour\u2014or a yacht.\u201D \u201CLook at this,\u201D said Gatsby
        quickly. \u201CHere\u2019s a lot of clippings\u2014about you.\u201D They
        stood side by side examining it. I was going to ask to see the rubies when
        the phone rang, and Gatsby took up the receiver. \u201CYes\u2026 Well, I
        can\u2019t talk now\u2026 I can\u2019t talk now, old sport\u2026 I said a
        small town\u2026 He must know what a small town is\u2026 Well, he\u2019s
        no use to us if Detroit is his idea of a small town\u2026\u201D He rang off.
        \u201CCome here quick!\u201D cried Daisy at the window. The rain was still
        falling, but the darkness had parted in the west, and there was a pink and
        golden billow of foamy clouds above the sea. \u201CLook at that,\u201D she
        whispered, and then after a moment: \u201CI\u2019d like to just get one of
        those pink clouds and put you in it and push you around.\u201D I tried to
        go then, but they wouldn\u2019t hear of it; perhaps my presence made them
        feel more satisfactorily alone. \u201CI know what we\u2019ll do,\u201D said
        Gatsby, \u201Cwe\u2019ll have Klipspringer play the piano.\u201D He went
        out of the room calling \u201CEwing!\u201D and returned in a few minutes
        accompanied by an embarrassed, slightly worn young man, with shell-rimmed
        glasses and scanty blond hair. He was now decently clothed in a \u201Csport
        shirt,\u201D open at the neck, sneakers, and duck trousers of a nebulous
        hue. \u201CDid we interrupt your exercise?\u201D inquired Daisy politely.
        \u201CI was asleep,\u201D cried Mr. Klipspringer, in a spasm of embarrassment.
        \u201CThat is, I\u2019d been asleep. Then I got up\u2026\u201D \u201CKlipspringer
        plays the piano,\u201D said Gatsby, cutting him off. \u201CDon\u2019t you,
        Ewing, old sport?\u201D \u201CI don\u2019t play well. I don\u2019t\u2014hardly
        play at all. I\u2019m all out of prac\u2014\u201D \u201CWe\u2019ll go downstairs,\u201D
        interrupted Gatsby. He flipped a switch. The grey windows disappeared as
        the house glowed full of light. In the music-room Gatsby turned on a solitary
        lamp beside the piano. He lit Daisy\u2019s cigarette from a trembling match,
        and sat down with her on a couch far across the room, where there was no
        light save what the gleaming floor bounced in from the hall. When Klipspringer
        had played \u201CThe Love Nest\u201D he turned around on the bench and searched
        unhappily for Gatsby in the gloom. \u201CI\u2019m all out of practice, you
        see. I told you I couldn\u2019t play. I\u2019m all out of prac\u2014\u201D
        \u201CDon\u2019t talk so much, old sport,\u201D commanded Gatsby. \u201CPlay!\u201D
        \u201CIn the morning, In the evening, Ain\u2019t we got fun\u2014\u201D Outside
        the wind was loud and there was a faint flow of thunder along the Sound.
        All the lights were going on in West Egg now; the electric trains, men-carrying,
        were plunging home through the rain from New York. It was the hour of a profound
        human change, and excitement was generating on the air. \u201COne thing\u2019s
        sure and nothing\u2019s surer The rich get richer and the poor get\u2014children.
        In the meantime,  In between time\u2014\u201D As I went over to say goodbye
        I saw that the expression of bewilderment had come back into Gatsby\u2019s
        face, as though a faint doubt had occurred to him as to the quality of his
        present happiness. Almost five years! There must have been moments even that
        afternoon when Daisy tumbled short of his dreams\u2014not through her own
        fault, but because of the colossal vitality of his illusion. It had gone
        beyond her, beyond everything. He had thrown himself into it with a creative
        passion, adding to it all the time, decking it out with every bright feather
        that drifted his way. No amount of fire or freshness can challenge what a
        man can store up in his ghostly heart. As I watched him he adjusted himself
        a little, visibly. His hand took hold of hers, and as she said something
        low in his ear he turned toward her with a rush of emotion. I think that
        voice held him most, with its fluctuating, feverish warmth, because it couldn\u2019t
        be over-dreamed\u2014that voice was a deathless song. They had forgotten
        me, but Daisy glanced up and held out her hand; Gatsby didn\u2019t know me
        now at all. I looked once more at them and they looked back at me, remotely,
        possessed by intense life. Then I went out of the room and down the marble
        steps into the rain, leaving them there together. "
