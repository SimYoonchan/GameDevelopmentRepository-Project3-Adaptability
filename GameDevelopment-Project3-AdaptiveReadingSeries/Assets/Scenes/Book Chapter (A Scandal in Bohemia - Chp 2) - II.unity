      value: "At three o\u2019clock precisely I was at Baker Street, but Holmes had
        not yet returned. The landlady informed me that he had left the house shortly
        after eight o\u2019clock in the morning. I sat down beside the fire, however,
        with the intention of awaiting him, however long he might be. I was already
        deeply interested in his inquiry, for, though it was surrounded by none of
        the grim and strange features which were associated with the two crimes which
        I have already recorded, still, the nature of the case and the exalted station
        of his client gave it a character of its own. Indeed, apart from the nature
        of the investigation which my friend had on hand, there was something in
        his masterly grasp of a situation, and his keen, incisive reasoning, which
        made it a pleasure to me to study his system of work, and to follow the quick,
        subtle methods by which he disentangled the most inextricable mysteries.
        So accustomed was I to his invariable success that the very possibility of
        his failing had ceased to enter into my head. It was close upon four before
        the door opened, and a drunken-looking groom, ill-kempt and side-whiskered,
        with an inflamed face and disreputable clothes, walked into the room. Accustomed
        as I was to my friend\u2019s amazing powers in the use of disguises, I had
        to look three times before I was certain that it was indeed he. With a nod
        he vanished into the bedroom, whence he emerged in five minutes tweed-suited
        and respectable, as of old. Putting his hands into his pockets, he stretched
        out his legs in front of the fire and laughed heartily for some minutes.
        \u201CWell, really!\u201D he cried, and then he choked and laughed again
        until he was obliged to lie back, limp and helpless, in the chair. \u201CWhat
        is it?\u201D \u201CIt\u2019s quite too funny. I am sure you could never guess
        how I employed my morning, or what I ended by doing.\u201D \u201CI can\u2019t
        imagine. I suppose that you have been watching the habits, and perhaps the
        house, of Miss Irene Adler.\u201D \u201CQuite so; but the sequel was rather
        unusual. I will tell you, however. I left the house a little after eight
        o\u2019clock this morning in the character of a groom out of work. There
        is a wonderful sympathy and freemasonry among horsey men. Be one of them,
        and you will know all that there is to know. I soon found Briony Lodge. It
        is a bijou villa, with a garden at the back, but built out in front right
        up to the road, two stories. Chubb lock to the door. Large sitting-room on
        the right side, well furnished, with long windows almost to the floor, and
        those preposterous English window fasteners which a child could open. Behind
        there was nothing remarkable, save that the passage window could be reached
        from the top of the coach-house. I walked round it and examined it closely
        from every point of view, but without noting anything else of interest. \u201CI
        then lounged down the street and found, as I expected, that there was a mews
        in a lane which runs down by one wall of the garden. I lent the ostlers a
        hand in rubbing down their horses, and received in exchange twopence, a glass
        of half-and-half, two fills of shag tobacco, and as much information as I
        could desire about Miss Adler, to say nothing of half a dozen other people
        in the neighbourhood in whom I was not in the least interested, but whose
        biographies I was compelled to listen to.\u201D \u201CAnd what of Irene Adler?\u201D
        I asked. \u201COh, she has turned all the men\u2019s heads down in that part.
        She is the daintiest thing under a bonnet on this planet. So say the Serpentine-mews,
        to a man. She lives quietly, sings at concerts, drives out at five every
        day, and returns at seven sharp for dinner. Seldom goes out at other times,
        except when she sings. Has only one male visitor, but a good deal of him.
        He is dark, handsome, and dashing, never calls less than once a day, and
        often twice. He is a Mr. Godfrey Norton, of the Inner Temple. See the advantages
        of a cabman as a confidant. They had driven him home a dozen times from Serpentine-mews,
        and knew all about him. When I had listened to all they had to tell, I began
        to walk up and down near Briony Lodge once more, and to think over my plan
        of campaign. \u201CThis Godfrey Norton was evidently an important factor
        in the matter. He was a lawyer. That sounded ominous. What was the relation
        between them, and what the object of his repeated visits? Was she his client,
        his friend, or his mistress? If the former, she had probably transferred
        the photograph to his keeping. If the latter, it was less likely. On the
        issue of this question depended whether I should continue my work at Briony
        Lodge, or turn my attention to the gentleman\u2019s chambers in the Temple.
        It was a delicate point, and it widened the field of my inquiry. I fear that
        I bore you with these details, but I have to let you see my little difficulties,
        if you are to understand the situation.\u201D \u201CI am following you closely,\u201D
        I answered. \u201CI was still balancing the matter in my mind when a hansom
        cab drove up to Briony Lodge, and a gentleman sprang out. He was a remarkably
        handsome man, dark, aquiline, and moustached\u2014evidently the man of whom
        I had heard. He appeared to be in a great hurry, shouted to the cabman to
        wait, and brushed past the maid who opened the door with the air of a man
        who was thoroughly at home. \u201CHe was in the house about half an hour,
        and I could catch glimpses of him in the windows of the sitting-room, pacing
        up and down, talking excitedly, and waving his arms. Of her I could see nothing.
        Presently he emerged, looking even more flurried than before. As he stepped
        up to the cab, he pulled a gold watch from his pocket and looked at it earnestly,
        \u2018Drive like the devil,\u2019 he shouted, \u2018first to Gross & Hankey\u2019s
        in Regent Street, and then to the Church of St. Monica in the Edgeware Road.
        Half a guinea if you do it in twenty minutes!\u2019 \u201CAway they went,
        and I was just wondering whether I should not do well to follow them when
        up the lane came a neat little landau, the coachman with his coat only half-buttoned,
        and his tie under his ear, while all the tags of his harness were sticking
        out of the buckles. It hadn\u2019t pulled up before she shot out of the hall
        door and into it. I only caught a glimpse of her at the moment, but she was
        a lovely woman, with a face that a man might die for. \u201C\u2018The Church
        of St. Monica, John,\u2019 she cried, \u2018and half a sovereign if you reach
        it in twenty minutes.\u2019 \u201CThis was quite too good to lose, Watson.
        I was just balancing whether I should run for it, or whether I should perch
        behind her landau when a cab came through the street. The driver looked twice
        at such a shabby fare, but I jumped in before he could object. \u2018The
        Church of St. Monica,\u2019 said I, \u2018and half a sovereign if you reach
        it in twenty minutes.\u2019 It was twenty-five minutes to twelve, and of
        course it was clear enough what was in the wind. \u201CMy cabby drove fast.
        I don\u2019t think I ever drove faster, but the others were there before
        us. The cab and the landau with their steaming horses were in front of the
        door when I arrived. I paid the man and hurried into the church. There was
        not a soul there save the two whom I had followed and a surpliced clergyman,
        who seemed to be expostulating with them. They were all three standing in
        a knot in front of the altar. I lounged up the side aisle like any other
        idler who has dropped into a church. Suddenly, to my surprise, the three
        at the altar faced round to me, and Godfrey Norton came running as hard as
        he could towards me. \u201C\u2018Thank God,\u2019 he cried. \u2018You\u2019ll
        do. Come! Come!\u2019 \u201C\u2018What then?\u2019 I asked. \u201C\u2018Come,
        man, come, only three minutes, or it won\u2019t be legal.\u2019 \u201CI was
        half-dragged up to the altar, and before I knew where I was I found myself
        mumbling responses which were whispered in my ear, and vouching for things
        of which I knew nothing, and generally assisting in the secure tying up of
        Irene Adler, spinster, to Godfrey Norton, bachelor. It was all done in an
        instant, and there was the gentleman thanking me on the one side and the
        lady on the other, while the clergyman beamed on me in front. It was the
        most preposterous position in which I ever found myself in my life, and it
        was the thought of it that started me laughing just now. It seems that there
        had been some informality about their license, that the clergyman absolutely
        refused to marry them without a witness of some sort, and that my lucky appearance
        saved the bridegroom from having to sally out into the streets in search
        of a best man. The bride gave me a sovereign, and I mean to wear it on my
        watch chain in memory of the occasion.\u201D \u201CThis is a very unexpected
        turn of affairs,\u201D said I; \u201Cand what then?\u201D \u201CWell, I found
        my plans very seriously menaced. It looked as if the pair might take an immediate
        departure, and so necessitate very prompt and energetic measures on my part.
        At the church door, however, they separated, he driving back to the Temple,
        and she to her own house. \u2018I shall drive out in the park at five as
        usual,\u2019 she said as she left him. I heard no more. They drove away in
        different directions, and I went off to make my own arrangements.\u201D \u201CWhich
        are?\u201D \u201CSome cold beef and a glass of beer,\u201D he answered, ringing
        the bell. \u201CI have been too busy to think of food, and I am likely to
        be busier still this evening. By the way, Doctor, I shall want your co-operation.\u201D
        \u201CI shall be delighted.\u201D \u201CYou don\u2019t mind breaking the
        law?\u201D \u201CNot in the least.\u201D \u201CNor running a chance of arrest?\u201D
        \u201CNot in a good cause.\u201D \u201COh, the cause is excellent!\u201D
        \u201CThen I am your man.\u201D \u201CI was sure that I might rely on you.\u201D
        \u201CBut what is it you wish?\u201D \u201CWhen Mrs. Turner has brought in
        the tray I will make it clear to you. Now,\u201D he said as he turned hungrily
        on the simple fare that our landlady had provided, \u201CI must discuss it
        while I eat, for I have not much time. It is nearly five now. In two hours
        we must be on the scene of action. Miss Irene, or Madame, rather, returns
        from her drive at seven. We must be at Briony Lodge to meet her.\u201D \u201CAnd
        what then?\u201D \u201CYou must leave that to me. I have already arranged
        what is to occur. There is only one point on which I must insist. You must
        not interfere, come what may. You understand?\u201D \u201CI am to be neutral?\u201D
        \u201CTo do nothing whatever. There will probably be some small unpleasantness.
        Do not join in it. It will end in my being conveyed into the house. Four
        or five minutes afterwards the sitting-room window will open. You are to
        station yourself close to that open window.\u201D \u201CYes.\u201D \u201CYou
        are to watch me, for I will be visible to you.\u201D \u201CYes.\u201D \u201CAnd
        when I raise my hand\u2014so\u2014you will throw into the room what I give
        you to throw, and will, at the same time, raise the cry of fire. You quite
        follow me?\u201D \u201CEntirely.\u201D \u201CIt is nothing very formidable,\u201D
        he said, taking a long cigar-shaped roll from his pocket. \u201CIt is an
        ordinary plumber\u2019s smoke-rocket, fitted with a cap at either end to
        make it self-lighting. Your task is confined to that. When you raise your
        cry of fire, it will be taken up by quite a number of people. You may then
        walk to the end of the street, and I will rejoin you in ten minutes. I hope
        that I have made myself clear?\u201D \u201CI am to remain neutral, to get
        near the window, to watch you, and at the signal to throw in this object,
        then to raise the cry of fire, and to wait you at the corner of the street.\u201D
        \u201CPrecisely.\u201D \u201CThen you may entirely rely on me.\u201D \u201CThat
        is excellent. I think, perhaps, it is almost time that I prepare for the
        new role I have to play.\u201D He disappeared into his bedroom and returned
        in a few minutes in the character of an amiable and simple-minded Nonconformist
        clergyman. His broad black hat, his baggy trousers, his white tie, his sympathetic
        smile, and general look of peering and benevolent curiosity were such as
        Mr. John Hare alone could have equalled. It was not merely that Holmes changed
        his costume. His expression, his manner, his very soul seemed to vary with
        every fresh part that he assumed. The stage lost a fine actor, even as science
        lost an acute reasoner, when he became a specialist in crime. It was a quarter
        past six when we left Baker Street, and it still wanted ten minutes to the
        hour when we found ourselves in Serpentine Avenue. It was already dusk, and
        the lamps were just being lighted as we paced up and down in front of Briony
        Lodge, waiting for the coming of its occupant. The house was just such as
        I had pictured it from Sherlock Holmes\u2019 succinct description, but the
        locality appeared to be less private than I expected. On the contrary, for
        a small street in a quiet neighbourhood, it was remarkably animated. There
        was a group of shabbily dressed men smoking and laughing in a corner, a scissors-grinder
        with his wheel, two guardsmen who were flirting with a nurse-girl, and several
        well-dressed young men who were lounging up and down with cigars in their
        mouths. \u201CYou see,\u201D remarked Holmes, as we paced to and fro in front
        of the house, \u201Cthis marriage rather simplifies matters. The photograph
        becomes a double-edged weapon now. The chances are that she would be as averse
        to its being seen by Mr. Godfrey Norton, as our client is to its coming to
        the eyes of his princess. Now the question is, Where are we to find the photograph?\u201D
        \u201CWhere, indeed?\u201D \u201CIt is most unlikely that she carries it
        about with her. It is cabinet size. Too large for easy concealment about
        a woman\u2019s dress. She knows that the King is capable of having her waylaid
        and searched. Two attempts of the sort have already been made. We may take
        it, then, that she does not carry it about with her.\u201D \u201CWhere, then?\u201D
        \u201CHer banker or her lawyer. There is that double possibility. But I am
        inclined to think neither. Women are naturally secretive, and they like to
        do their own secreting. Why should she hand it over to anyone else? She could
        trust her own guardianship, but she could not tell what indirect or political
        influence might be brought to bear upon a business man. Besides, remember
        that she had resolved to use it within a few days. It must be where she can
        lay her hands upon it. It must be in her own house.\u201D \u201CBut it has
        twice been burgled.\u201D \u201CPshaw! They did not know how to look.\u201D
        \u201CBut how will you look?\u201D \u201CI will not look.\u201D \u201CWhat
        then?\u201D \u201CI will get her to show me.\u201D \u201CBut she will refuse.\u201D
        \u201CShe will not be able to. But I hear the rumble of wheels. It is her
        carriage. Now carry out my orders to the letter.\u201D As he spoke the gleam
        of the sidelights of a carriage came round the curve of the avenue. It was
        a smart little landau which rattled up to the door of Briony Lodge. As it
        pulled up, one of the loafing men at the corner dashed forward to open the
        door in the hope of earning a copper, but was elbowed away by another loafer,
        who had rushed up with the same intention. A fierce quarrel broke out, which
        was increased by the two guardsmen, who took sides with one of the loungers,
        and by the scissors-grinder, who was equally hot upon the other side. A blow
        was struck, and in an instant the lady, who had stepped from her carriage,
        was the centre of a little knot of flushed and struggling men, who struck
        savagely at each other with their fists and sticks. Holmes dashed into the
        crowd to protect the lady; but, just as he reached her, he gave a cry and
        dropped to the ground, with the blood running freely down his face. At his
        fall the guardsmen took to their heels in one direction and the loungers
        in the other, while a number of better dressed people, who had watched the
        scuffle without taking part in it, crowded in to help the lady and to attend
        to the injured man. Irene Adler, as I will still call her, had hurried up
        the steps; but she stood at the top with her superb figure outlined against
        the lights of the hall, looking back into the street. \u201CIs the poor gentleman
        much hurt?\u201D she asked. \u201CHe is dead,\u201D cried several voices.
        \u201CNo, no, there\u2019s life in him!\u201D shouted another. \u201CBut
        he\u2019ll be gone before you can get him to hospital.\u201D \u201CHe\u2019s
        a brave fellow,\u201D said a woman. \u201CThey would have had the lady\u2019s
        purse and watch if it hadn\u2019t been for him. They were a gang, and a rough
        one, too. Ah, he\u2019s breathing now.\u201D \u201CHe can\u2019t lie in the
        street. May we bring him in, marm?\u201D \u201CSurely. Bring him into the
        sitting-room. There is a comfortable sofa. This way, please!\u201D Slowly
        and solemnly he was borne into Briony Lodge and laid out in the principal
        room, while I still observed the proceedings from my post by the window.
        The lamps had been lit, but the blinds had not been drawn, so that I could
        see Holmes as he lay upon the couch. I do not know whether he was seized
        with compunction at that moment for the part he was playing, but I know that
        I never felt more heartily ashamed of myself in my life than when I saw the
        beautiful creature against whom I was conspiring, or the grace and kindliness
        with which she waited upon the injured man. And yet it would be the blackest
        treachery to Holmes to draw back now from the part which he had intrusted
        to me. I hardened my heart, and took the smoke-rocket from under my ulster.
        After all, I thought, we are not injuring her. We are but preventing her
        from injuring another. Holmes had sat up upon the couch, and I saw him motion
        like a man who is in need of air. A maid rushed across and threw open the
        window. At the same instant I saw him raise his hand and at the signal I
        tossed my rocket into the room with a cry of \u201CFire!\u201D The word was
        no sooner out of my mouth than the whole crowd of spectators, well dressed
        and ill\u2014gentlemen, ostlers, and servant maids\u2014joined in a general
        shriek of \u201CFire!\u201D Thick clouds of smoke curled through the room
        and out at the open window. I caught a glimpse of rushing figures, and a
        moment later the voice of Holmes from within assuring them that it was a
        false alarm. Slipping through the shouting crowd I made my way to the corner
        of the street, and in ten minutes was rejoiced to find my friend\u2019s arm
        in mine, and to get away from the scene of uproar. He walked swiftly and
        in silence for some few minutes until we had turned down one of the quiet
        streets which lead towards the Edgeware Road. \u201CYou did it very nicely,
        Doctor,\u201D he remarked. \u201CNothing could have been better. It is all
        right.\u201D \u201CYou have the photograph?\u201D \u201CI know where it is.\u201D
        \u201CAnd how did you find out?\u201D \u201CShe showed me, as I told you
        she would.\u201D \u201CI am still in the dark.\u201D \u201CI do not wish
        to make a mystery,\u201D said he, laughing. \u201CThe matter was perfectly
        simple. You, of course, saw that everyone in the street was an accomplice.
        They were all engaged for the evening.\u201D \u201CI guessed as much.\u201D
        \u201CThen, when the row broke out, I had a little moist red paint in the
        palm of my hand. I rushed forward, fell down, clapped my hand to my face,
        and became a piteous spectacle. It is an old trick.\u201D \u201CThat also
        I could fathom.\u201D \u201CThen they carried me in. She was bound to have
        me in. What else could she do? And into her sitting-room, which was the very
        room which I suspected. It lay between that and her bedroom, and I was determined
        to see which. They laid me on a couch, I motioned for air, they were compelled
        to open the window, and you had your chance.\u201D \u201CHow did that help
        you?\u201D \u201CIt was all-important. When a woman thinks that her house
        is on fire, her instinct is at once to rush to the thing which she values
        most. It is a perfectly overpowering impulse, and I have more than once taken
        advantage of it. In the case of the Darlington Substitution Scandal it was
        of use to me, and also in the Arnsworth Castle business. A married woman
        grabs at her baby; an unmarried one reaches for her jewel-box. Now it was
        clear to me that our lady of to-day had nothing in the house more precious
        to her than what we are in quest of. She would rush to secure it. The alarm
        of fire was admirably done. The smoke and shouting were enough to shake nerves
        of steel. She responded beautifully. The photograph is in a recess behind
        a sliding panel just above the right bell-pull. She was there in an instant,
        and I caught a glimpse of it as she half drew it out. When I cried out that
        it was a false alarm, she replaced it, glanced at the rocket, rushed from
        the room, and I have not seen her since. I rose, and, making my excuses,
        escaped from the house. I hesitated whether to attempt to secure the photograph
        at once; but the coachman had come in, and as he was watching me narrowly,
        it seemed safer to wait. A little over-precipitance may ruin all.\u201D \u201CAnd
        now?\u201D I asked. \u201COur quest is practically finished. I shall call
        with the King to-morrow, and with you, if you care to come with us. We will
        be shown into the sitting-room to wait for the lady, but it is probable that
        when she comes she may find neither us nor the photograph. It might be a
        satisfaction to his Majesty to regain it with his own hands.\u201D \u201CAnd
        when will you call?\u201D \u201CAt eight in the morning. She will not be
        up, so that we shall have a clear field. Besides, we must be prompt, for
        this marriage may mean a complete change in her life and habits. I must wire
        to the King without delay.\u201D We had reached Baker Street and had stopped
        at the door. He was searching his pockets for the key when someone passing
        said: \u201CGood-night, Mister Sherlock Holmes.\u201D There were several
        people on the pavement at the time, but the greeting appeared to come from
        a slim youth in an ulster who had hurried by. \u201CI\u2019ve heard that
        voice before,\u201D said Holmes, staring down the dimly lit street. \u201CNow,
        I wonder who the deuce that could have been.\u201D"
