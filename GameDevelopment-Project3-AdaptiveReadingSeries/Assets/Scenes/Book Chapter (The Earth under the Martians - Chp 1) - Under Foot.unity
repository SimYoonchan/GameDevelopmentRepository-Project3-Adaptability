      value: "In the first book I have wandered so much from my own adventures to
        tell of the experiences of my brother that all through the last two chapters
        I and the curate have been lurking in the empty house at Halliford whither
        we fled to escape the Black Smoke. There I will resume. We stopped there
        all Sunday night and all the next day\u2014the day of the panic\u2014in a
        little island of daylight, cut off by the Black Smoke from the rest of the
        world. We could do nothing but wait in aching inactivity during those two
        weary days. My mind was occupied by anxiety for my wife. I figured her at
        Leatherhead, terrified, in danger, mourning me already as a dead man. I paced
        the rooms and cried aloud when I thought of how I was cut off from her, of
        all that might happen to her in my absence. My cousin I knew was brave enough
        for any emergency, but he was not the sort of man to realise danger quickly,
        to rise promptly. What was needed now was not bravery, but circumspection.
        My only consolation was to believe that the Martians were moving Londonward
        and away from her. Such vague anxieties keep the mind sensitive and painful.
        I grew very weary and irritable with the curate\u2019s perpetual ejaculations;
        I tired of the sight of his selfish despair. After some ineffectual remonstrance
        I kept away from him, staying in a room\u2014evidently a children\u2019s
        schoolroom\u2014containing globes, forms, and copybooks. When he followed
        me thither, I went to a box room at the top of the house and, in order to
        be alone with my aching miseries, locked myself in. We were hopelessly hemmed
        in by the Black Smoke all that day and the morning of the next. There were
        signs of people in the next house on Sunday evening\u2014a face at a window
        and moving lights, and later the slamming of a door. But I do not know who
        these people were, nor what became of them. We saw nothing of them next day.
        The Black Smoke drifted slowly riverward all through Monday morning, creeping
        nearer and nearer to us, driving at last along the roadway outside the house
        that hid us. A Martian came across the fields about midday, laying the stuff
        with a jet of superheated steam that hissed against the walls, smashed all
        the windows it touched, and scalded the curate\u2019s hand as he fled out
        of the front room. When at last we crept across the sodden rooms and looked
        out again, the country northward was as though a black snowstorm had passed
        over it. Looking towards the river, we were astonished to see an unaccountable
        redness mingling with the black of the scorched meadows. For a time we did
        not see how this change affected our position, save that we were relieved
        of our fear of the Black Smoke. But later I perceived that we were no longer
        hemmed in, that now we might get away. So soon as I realised that the way
        of escape was open, my dream of action returned. But the curate was lethargic,
        unreasonable. \u201CWe are safe here,\u201D he repeated; \u201Csafe here.\u201D
        I resolved to leave him\u2014would that I had! Wiser now for the artilleryman\u2019s
        teaching, I sought out food and drink. I had found oil and rags for my burns,
        and I also took a hat and a flannel shirt that I found in one of the bedrooms.
        When it was clear to him that I meant to go alone\u2014had reconciled myself
        to going alone\u2014he suddenly roused himself to come. And all being quiet
        throughout the afternoon, we started about five o\u2019clock, as I should
        judge, along the blackened road to Sunbury. In Sunbury, and at intervals
        along the road, were dead bodies lying in contorted attitudes, horses as
        well as men, overturned carts and luggage, all covered thickly with black
        dust. That pall of cindery powder made me think of what I had read of the
        destruction of Pompeii. We got to Hampton Court without misadventure, our
        minds full of strange and unfamiliar appearances, and at Hampton Court our
        eyes were relieved to find a patch of green that had escaped the suffocating
        drift. We went through Bushey Park, with its deer going to and fro under
        the chestnuts, and some men and women hurrying in the distance towards Hampton,
        and so we came to Twickenham. These were the first people we saw. Away across
        the road the woods beyond Ham and Petersham were still afire. Twickenham
        was uninjured by either Heat-Ray or Black Smoke, and there were more people
        about here, though none could give us news. For the most part they were like
        ourselves, taking advantage of a lull to shift their quarters. I have an
        impression that many of the houses here were still occupied by scared inhabitants,
        too frightened even for flight. Here too the evidence of a hasty rout was
        abundant along the road. I remember most vividly three smashed bicycles in
        a heap, pounded into the road by the wheels of subsequent carts. We crossed
        Richmond Bridge about half past eight. We hurried across the exposed bridge,
        of course, but I noticed floating down the stream a number of red masses,
        some many feet across. I did not know what these were\u2014there was no time
        for scrutiny\u2014and I put a more horrible interpretation on them than they
        deserved. Here again on the Surrey side were black dust that had once been
        smoke, and dead bodies\u2014a heap near the approach to the station; but
        we had no glimpse of the Martians until we were some way towards Barnes.
        We saw in the blackened distance a group of three people running down a side
        street towards the river, but otherwise it seemed deserted. Up the hill Richmond
        town was burning briskly; outside the town of Richmond there was no trace
        of the Black Smoke. Then suddenly, as we approached Kew, came a number of
        people running, and the upperworks of a Martian fighting-machine loomed in
        sight over the housetops, not a hundred yards away from us. We stood aghast
        at our danger, and had the Martian looked down we must immediately have perished.
        We were so terrified that we dared not go on, but turned aside and hid in
        a shed in a garden. There the curate crouched, weeping silently, and refusing
        to stir again. But my fixed idea of reaching Leatherhead would not let me
        rest, and in the twilight I ventured out again. I went through a shrubbery,
        and along a passage beside a big house standing in its own grounds, and so
        emerged upon the road towards Kew. The curate I left in the shed, but he
        came hurrying after me. That second start was the most foolhardy thing I
        ever did. For it was manifest the Martians were about us. No sooner had the
        curate overtaken me than we saw either the fighting-machine we had seen before
        or another, far away across the meadows in the direction of Kew Lodge. Four
        or five little black figures hurried before it across the green-grey of the
        field, and in a moment it was evident this Martian pursued them. In three
        strides he was among them, and they ran radiating from his feet in all directions.
        He used no Heat-Ray to destroy them, but picked them up one by one. Apparently
        he tossed them into the great metallic carrier which projected behind him,
        much as a workman\u2019s basket hangs over his shoulder. It was the first
        time I realised that the Martians might have any other purpose than destruction
        with defeated humanity. We stood for a moment petrified, then turned and
        fled through a gate behind us into a walled garden, fell into, rather than
        found, a fortunate ditch, and lay there, scarce daring to whisper to each
        other until the stars were out. I suppose it was nearly eleven o\u2019clock
        before we gathered courage to start again, no longer venturing into the road,
        but sneaking along hedgerows and through plantations, and watching keenly
        through the darkness, he on the right and I on the left, for the Martians,
        who seemed to be all about us. In one place we blundered upon a scorched
        and blackened area, now cooling and ashen, and a number of scattered dead
        bodies of men, burned horribly about the heads and trunks but with their
        legs and boots mostly intact; and of dead horses, fifty feet, perhaps, behind
        a line of four ripped guns and smashed gun carriages. Sheen, it seemed, had
        escaped destruction, but the place was silent and deserted. Here we happened
        on no dead, though the night was too dark for us to see into the side roads
        of the place. In Sheen my companion suddenly complained of faintness and
        thirst, and we decided to try one of the houses. The first house we entered,
        after a little difficulty with the window, was a small semi-detached villa,
        and I found nothing eatable left in the place but some mouldy cheese. There
        was, however, water to drink; and I took a hatchet, which promised to be
        useful in our next house-breaking. We then crossed to a place where the road
        turns towards Mortlake. Here there stood a white house within a walled garden,
        and in the pantry of this domicile we found a store of food\u2014two loaves
        of bread in a pan, an uncooked steak, and the half of a ham. I give this
        catalogue so precisely because, as it happened, we were destined to subsist
        upon this store for the next fortnight. Bottled beer stood under a shelf,
        and there were two bags of haricot beans and some limp lettuces. This pantry
        opened into a kind of wash-up kitchen, and in this was firewood; there was
        also a cupboard, in which we found nearly a dozen of burgundy, tinned soups
        and salmon, and two tins of biscuits. We sat in the adjacent kitchen in the
        dark\u2014for we dared not strike a light\u2014and ate bread and ham, and
        drank beer out of the same bottle. The curate, who was still timorous and
        restless, was now, oddly enough, for pushing on, and I was urging him to
        keep up his strength by eating when the thing happened that was to imprison
        us. \u201CIt can\u2019t be midnight yet,\u201D I said, and then came a blinding
        glare of vivid green light. Everything in the kitchen leaped out, clearly
        visible in green and black, and vanished again. And then followed such a
        concussion as I have never heard before or since. So close on the heels of
        this as to seem instantaneous came a thud behind me, a clash of glass, a
        crash and rattle of falling masonry all about us, and the plaster of the
        ceiling came down upon us, smashing into a multitude of fragments upon our
        heads. I was knocked headlong across the floor against the oven handle and
        stunned. I was insensible for a long time, the curate told me, and when I
        came to we were in darkness again, and he, with a face wet, as I found afterwards,
        with blood from a cut forehead, was dabbing water over me. For some time
        I could not recollect what had happened. Then things came to me slowly. A
        bruise on my temple asserted itself. \u201CAre you better?\u201D asked the
        curate in a whisper. At last I answered him. I sat up. \u201CDon\u2019t move,\u201D
        he said. \u201CThe floor is covered with smashed crockery from the dresser.
        You can\u2019t possibly move without making a noise, and I fancy they are
        outside.\u201D We both sat quite silent, so that we could scarcely hear each
        other breathing. Everything seemed deadly still, but once something near
        us, some plaster or broken brickwork, slid down with a rumbling sound. Outside
        and very near was an intermittent, metallic rattle. \u201CThat!\u201D said
        the curate, when presently it happened again. \u201CYes,\u201D I said. \u201CBut
        what is it?\u201D \u201CA Martian!\u201D said the curate. I listened again.
        \u201CIt was not like the Heat-Ray,\u201D I said, and for a time I was inclined
        to think one of the great fighting-machines had stumbled against the house,
        as I had seen one stumble against the tower of Shepperton Church. Our situation
        was so strange and incomprehensible that for three or four hours, until the
        dawn came, we scarcely moved. And then the light filtered in, not through
        the window, which remained black, but through a triangular aperture between
        a beam and a heap of broken bricks in the wall behind us. The interior of
        the kitchen we now saw greyly for the first time. The window had been burst
        in by a mass of garden mould, which flowed over the table upon which we had
        been sitting and lay about our feet. Outside, the soil was banked high against
        the house. At the top of the window frame we could see an uprooted drainpipe.
        The floor was littered with smashed hardware; the end of the kitchen towards
        the house was broken into, and since the daylight shone in there, it was
        evident the greater part of the house had collapsed. Contrasting vividly
        with this ruin was the neat dresser, stained in the fashion, pale green,
        and with a number of copper and tin vessels below it, the wallpaper imitating
        blue and white tiles, and a couple of coloured supplements fluttering from
        the walls above the kitchen range. As the dawn grew clearer, we saw through
        the gap in the wall the body of a Martian, standing sentinel, I suppose,
        over the still glowing cylinder. At the sight of that we crawled as circumspectly
        as possible out of the twilight of the kitchen into the darkness of the scullery.
        Abruptly the right interpretation dawned upon my mind. \u201CThe fifth cylinder,\u201D
        I whispered, \u201Cthe fifth shot from Mars, has struck this house and buried
        us under the ruins!\u201D For a time the curate was silent, and then he whispered:
        \u201CGod have mercy upon us!\u201D I heard him presently whimpering to himself.
        Save for that sound we lay quite still in the scullery; I for my part scarce
        dared breathe, and sat with my eyes fixed on the faint light of the kitchen
        door. I could just see the curate\u2019s face, a dim, oval shape, and his
        collar and cuffs. Outside there began a metallic hammering, then a violent
        hooting, and then again, after a quiet interval, a hissing like the hissing
        of an engine. These noises, for the most part problematical, continued intermittently,
        and seemed if anything to increase in number as time wore on. Presently a
        measured thudding and a vibration that made everything about us quiver and
        the vessels in the pantry ring and shift, began and continued. Once the light
        was eclipsed, and the ghostly kitchen doorway became absolutely dark. For
        many hours we must have crouched there, silent and shivering, until our tired
        attention failed. . . . At last I found myself awake and very hungry. I am
        inclined to believe we must have spent the greater portion of a day before
        that awakening. My hunger was at a stride so insistent that it moved me to
        action. I told the curate I was going to seek food, and felt my way towards
        the pantry. He made me no answer, but so soon as I began eating the faint
        noise I made stirred him up and I heard him crawling after me."
