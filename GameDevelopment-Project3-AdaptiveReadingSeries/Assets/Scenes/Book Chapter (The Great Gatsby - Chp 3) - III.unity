      value: "There was music from my neighbour\u2019s house through the summer nights.
        In his blue gardens men and girls came and went like moths among the whisperings
        and the champagne and the stars. At high tide in the afternoon I watched
        his guests diving from the tower of his raft, or taking the sun on the hot
        sand of his beach while his two motorboats slit the waters of the Sound,
        drawing aquaplanes over cataracts of foam. On weekends his Rolls-Royce became
        an omnibus, bearing parties to and from the city between nine in the morning
        and long past midnight, while his station wagon scampered like a brisk yellow
        bug to meet all trains. And on Mondays eight servants, including an extra
        gardener, toiled all day with mops and scrubbing-brushes and hammers and
        garden-shears, repairing the ravages of the night before. Every Friday five
        crates of oranges and lemons arrived from a fruiterer in New York\u2014every
        Monday these same oranges and lemons left his back door in a pyramid of pulpless
        halves. There was a machine in the kitchen which could extract the juice
        of two hundred oranges in half an hour if a little button was pressed two
        hundred times by a butler\u2019s thumb. At least once a fortnight a corps
        of caterers came down with several hundred feet of canvas and enough coloured
        lights to make a Christmas tree of Gatsby\u2019s enormous garden. On buffet
        tables, garnished with glistening hors-d\u2019oeuvre, spiced baked hams crowded
        against salads of harlequin designs and pastry pigs and turkeys bewitched
        to a dark gold. In the main hall a bar with a real brass rail was set up,
        and stocked with gins and liquors and with cordials so long forgotten that
        most of his female guests were too young to know one from another. By seven
        o\u2019clock the orchestra has arrived, no thin five-piece affair, but a
        whole pitful of oboes and trombones and saxophones and viols and cornets
        and piccolos, and low and high drums. The last swimmers have come in from
        the beach now and are dressing upstairs; the cars from New York are parked
        five deep in the drive, and already the halls and salons and verandas are
        gaudy with primary colours, and hair bobbed in strange new ways, and shawls
        beyond the dreams of Castile. The bar is in full swing, and floating rounds
        of cocktails permeate the garden outside, until the air is alive with chatter
        and laughter, and casual innuendo and introductions forgotten on the spot,
        and enthusiastic meetings between women who never knew each other\u2019s
        names. The lights grow brighter as the earth lurches away from the sun, and
        now the orchestra is playing yellow cocktail music, and the opera of voices
        pitches a key higher. Laughter is easier minute by minute, spilled with prodigality,
        tipped out at a cheerful word. The groups change more swiftly, swell with
        new arrivals, dissolve and form in the same breath; already there are wanderers,
        confident girls who weave here and there among the stouter and more stable,
        become for a sharp, joyous moment the centre of a group, and then, excited
        with triumph, glide on through the sea-change of faces and voices and colour
        under the constantly changing light. Suddenly one of these gypsies, in trembling
        opal, seizes a cocktail out of the air, dumps it down for courage and, moving
        her hands like Frisco, dances out alone on the canvas platform. A momentary
        hush; the orchestra leader varies his rhythm obligingly for her, and there
        is a burst of chatter as the erroneous news goes around that she is Gilda
        Gray\u2019s understudy from the Follies. The party has begun. I believe that
        on the first night I went to Gatsby\u2019s house I was one of the few guests
        who had actually been invited. People were not invited\u2014they went there.
        They got into automobiles which bore them out to Long Island, and somehow
        they ended up at Gatsby\u2019s door. Once there they were introduced by somebody
        who knew Gatsby, and after that they conducted themselves according to the
        rules of behaviour associated with an amusement park. Sometimes they came
        and went without having met Gatsby at all, came for the party with a simplicity
        of heart that was its own ticket of admission. I had been actually invited.
        A chauffeur in a uniform of robin\u2019s-egg blue crossed my lawn early that
        Saturday morning with a surprisingly formal note from his employer: the honour
        would be entirely Gatsby\u2019s, it said, if I would attend his \u201Clittle
        party\u201D that night. He had seen me several times, and had intended to
        call on me long before, but a peculiar combination of circumstances had prevented
        it\u2014signed Jay Gatsby, in a majestic hand. Dressed up in white flannels
        I went over to his lawn a little after seven, and wandered around rather
        ill at ease among swirls and eddies of people I didn\u2019t know\u2014though
        here and there was a face I had noticed on the commuting train. I was immediately
        struck by the number of young Englishmen dotted about; all well dressed,
        all looking a little hungry, and all talking in low, earnest voices to solid
        and prosperous Americans. I was sure that they were selling something: bonds
        or insurance or automobiles. They were at least agonizingly aware of the
        easy money in the vicinity and convinced that it was theirs for a few words
        in the right key. As soon as I arrived I made an attempt to find my host,
        but the two or three people of whom I asked his whereabouts stared at me
        in such an amazed way, and denied so vehemently any knowledge of his movements,
        that I slunk off in the direction of the cocktail table\u2014the only place
        in the garden where a single man could linger without looking purposeless
        and alone. I was on my way to get roaring drunk from sheer embarrassment
        when Jordan Baker came out of the house and stood at the head of the marble
        steps, leaning a little backward and looking with contemptuous interest down
        into the garden. Welcome or not, I found it necessary to attach myself to
        someone before I should begin to address cordial remarks to the passersby.
        \u201CHello!\u201D I roared, advancing toward her. My voice seemed unnaturally
        loud across the garden. \u201CI thought you might be here,\u201D she responded
        absently as I came up. \u201CI remembered you lived next door to\u2014\u201D
        She held my hand impersonally, as a promise that she\u2019d take care of
        me in a minute, and gave ear to two girls in twin yellow dresses, who stopped
        at the foot of the steps. \u201CHello!\u201D they cried together. \u201CSorry
        you didn\u2019t win.\u201D That was for the golf tournament. She had lost
        in the finals the week before. \u201CYou don\u2019t know who we are,\u201D
        said one of the girls in yellow, \u201Cbut we met you here about a month
        ago.\u201D \u201CYou\u2019ve dyed your hair since then,\u201D remarked Jordan,
        and I started, but the girls had moved casually on and her remark was addressed
        to the premature moon, produced like the supper, no doubt, out of a caterer\u2019s
        basket. With Jordan\u2019s slender golden arm resting in mine, we descended
        the steps and sauntered about the garden. A tray of cocktails floated at
        us through the twilight, and we sat down at a table with the two girls in
        yellow and three men, each one introduced to us as Mr. Mumble. \u201CDo you
        come to these parties often?\u201D inquired Jordan of the girl beside her.
        \u201CThe last one was the one I met you at,\u201D answered the girl, in
        an alert confident voice. She turned to her companion: \u201CWasn\u2019t
        it for you, Lucille?\u201D It was for Lucille, too. \u201CI like to come,\u201D
        Lucille said. \u201CI never care what I do, so I always have a good time.
        When I was here last I tore my gown on a chair, and he asked me my name and
        address\u2014inside of a week I got a package from Croirier\u2019s with a
        new evening gown in it.\u201D \u201CDid you keep it?\u201D asked Jordan.
        \u201CSure I did. I was going to wear it tonight, but it was too big in the
        bust and had to be altered. It was gas blue with lavender beads. Two hundred
        and sixty-five dollars.\u201D \u201CThere\u2019s something funny about a
        fellow that\u2019ll do a thing like that,\u201D said the other girl eagerly.
        \u201CHe doesn\u2019t want any trouble with anybody.\u201D \u201CWho doesn\u2019t?\u201D
        I inquired. \u201CGatsby. Somebody told me\u2014\u201D The two girls and
        Jordan leaned together confidentially. \u201CSomebody told me they thought
        he killed a man once.\u201D A thrill passed over all of us. The three Mr.
        Mumbles bent forward and listened eagerly. \u201CI don\u2019t think it\u2019s
        so much that,\u201D argued Lucille sceptically; \u201CIt\u2019s more that
        he was a German spy during the war.\u201D One of the men nodded in confirmation.
        \u201CI heard that from a man who knew all about him, grew up with him in
        Germany,\u201D he assured us positively. \u201COh, no,\u201D said the first
        girl, \u201Cit couldn\u2019t be that, because he was in the American army
        during the war.\u201D As our credulity switched back to her she leaned forward
        with enthusiasm. \u201CYou look at him sometimes when he thinks nobody\u2019s
        looking at him. I\u2019ll bet he killed a man.\u201D She narrowed her eyes
        and shivered. Lucille shivered. We all turned and looked around for Gatsby.
        It was testimony to the romantic speculation he inspired that there were
        whispers about him from those who had found little that it was necessary
        to whisper about in this world. The first supper\u2014there would be another
        one after midnight\u2014was now being served, and Jordan invited me to join
        her own party, who were spread around a table on the other side of the garden.
        There were three married couples and Jordan\u2019s escort, a persistent undergraduate
        given to violent innuendo, and obviously under the impression that sooner
        or later Jordan was going to yield him up her person to a greater or lesser
        degree. Instead of rambling, this party had preserved a dignified homogeneity,
        and assumed to itself the function of representing the staid nobility of
        the countryside\u2014East Egg condescending to West Egg and carefully on
        guard against its spectroscopic gaiety. \u201CLet\u2019s get out,\u201D whispered
        Jordan, after a somehow wasteful and inappropriate half-hour; \u201Cthis
        is much too polite for me.\u201D We got up, and she explained that we were
        going to find the host: I had never met him, she said, and it was making
        me uneasy. The undergraduate nodded in a cynical, melancholy way. The bar,
        where we glanced first, was crowded, but Gatsby was not there. She couldn\u2019t
        find him from the top of the steps, and he wasn\u2019t on the veranda. On
        a chance we tried an important-looking door, and walked into a high Gothic
        library, panelled with carved English oak, and probably transported complete
        from some ruin overseas. A stout, middle-aged man, with enormous owl-eyed
        spectacles, was sitting somewhat drunk on the edge of a great table, staring
        with unsteady concentration at the shelves of books. As we entered he wheeled
        excitedly around and examined Jordan from head to foot. \u201CWhat do you
        think?\u201D he demanded impetuously. \u201CAbout what?\u201D He waved his
        hand toward the bookshelves. \u201CAbout that. As a matter of fact you needn\u2019t
        bother to ascertain. I ascertained. They\u2019re real.\u201D \u201CThe books?\u201D
        He nodded. \u201CAbsolutely real\u2014have pages and everything. I thought
        they\u2019d be a nice durable cardboard. Matter of fact, they\u2019re absolutely
        real. Pages and\u2014Here! Lemme show you.\u201D Taking our scepticism for
        granted, he rushed to the bookcases and returned with Volume One of the Stoddard
        Lectures. \u201CSee!\u201D he cried triumphantly. \u201CIt\u2019s a bona-fide
        piece of printed matter. It fooled me. This fella\u2019s a regular Belasco.
        It\u2019s a triumph. What thoroughness! What realism! Knew when to stop,
        too\u2014didn\u2019t cut the pages. But what do you want? What do you expect?\u201D
        He snatched the book from me and replaced it hastily on its shelf, muttering
        that if one brick was removed the whole library was liable to collapse. \u201CWho
        brought you?\u201D he demanded. \u201COr did you just come? I was brought.
        Most people were brought.\u201D Jordan looked at him alertly, cheerfully,
        without answering. \u201CI was brought by a woman named Roosevelt,\u201D
        he continued. \u201CMrs. Claud Roosevelt. Do you know her? I met her somewhere
        last night. I\u2019ve been drunk for about a week now, and I thought it might
        sober me up to sit in a library.\u201D \u201CHas it?\u201D \u201CA little
        bit, I think. I can\u2019t tell yet. I\u2019ve only been here an hour. Did
        I tell you about the books? They\u2019re real. They\u2019re\u2014\u201D \u201CYou
        told us.\u201D We shook hands with him gravely and went back outdoors. There
        was dancing now on the canvas in the garden; old men pushing young girls
        backward in eternal graceless circles, superior couples holding each other
        tortuously, fashionably, and keeping in the corners\u2014and a great number
        of single girls dancing individually or relieving the orchestra for a moment
        of the burden of the banjo or the traps. By midnight the hilarity had increased.
        A celebrated tenor had sung in Italian, and a notorious contralto had sung
        in jazz, and between the numbers people were doing \u201Cstunts\u201D all
        over the garden, while happy, vacuous bursts of laughter rose toward the
        summer sky. A pair of stage twins, who turned out to be the girls in yellow,
        did a baby act in costume, and champagne was served in glasses bigger than
        finger-bowls. The moon had risen higher, and floating in the Sound was a
        triangle of silver scales, trembling a little to the stiff, tinny drip of
        the banjoes on the lawn. I was still with Jordan Baker. We were sitting at
        a table with a man of about my age and a rowdy little girl, who gave way
        upon the slightest provocation to uncontrollable laughter. I was enjoying
        myself now. I had taken two finger-bowls of champagne, and the scene had
        changed before my eyes into something significant, elemental, and profound.
        At a lull in the entertainment the man looked at me and smiled. \u201CYour
        face is familiar,\u201D he said politely. \u201CWeren\u2019t you in the First
        Division during the war?\u201D \u201CWhy yes. I was in the Twenty-eighth
        Infantry.\u201D \u201CI was in the Sixteenth until June nineteen-eighteen.
        I knew I\u2019d seen you somewhere before.\u201D We talked for a moment about
        some wet, grey little villages in France. Evidently he lived in this vicinity,
        for he told me that he had just bought a hydroplane, and was going to try
        it out in the morning. \u201CWant to go with me, old sport? Just near the
        shore along the Sound.\u201D \u201CWhat time?\u201D \u201CAny time that suits
        you best.\u201D It was on the tip of my tongue to ask his name when Jordan
        looked around and smiled. \u201CHaving a gay time now?\u201D she inquired.
        \u201CMuch better.\u201D I turned again to my new acquaintance. \u201CThis
        is an unusual party for me. I haven\u2019t even seen the host. I live over
        there\u2014\u201D I waved my hand at the invisible hedge in the distance,
        \u201Cand this man Gatsby sent over his chauffeur with an invitation.\u201D
        For a moment he looked at me as if he failed to understand. \u201CI\u2019m
        Gatsby,\u201D he said suddenly. \u201CWhat!\u201D I exclaimed. \u201COh,
        I beg your pardon.\u201D \u201CI thought you knew, old sport. I\u2019m afraid
        I\u2019m not a very good host.\u201D He smiled understandingly\u2014much
        more than understandingly. It was one of those rare smiles with a quality
        of eternal reassurance in it, that you may come across four or five times
        in life. It faced\u2014or seemed to face\u2014the whole eternal world for
        an instant, and then concentrated on you with an irresistible prejudice in
        your favour. It understood you just so far as you wanted to be understood,
        believed in you as you would like to believe in yourself, and assured you
        that it had precisely the impression of you that, at your best, you hoped
        to convey. Precisely at that point it vanished\u2014and I was looking at
        an elegant young roughneck, a year or two over thirty, whose elaborate formality
        of speech just missed being absurd. Some time before he introduced himself
        I\u2019d got a strong impression that he was picking his words with care.
        Almost at the moment when Mr. Gatsby identified himself a butler hurried
        toward him with the information that Chicago was calling him on the wire.
        He excused himself with a small bow that included each of us in turn. \u201CIf
        you want anything just ask for it, old sport,\u201D he urged me. \u201CExcuse
        me. I will rejoin you later.\u201D When he was gone I turned immediately
        to Jordan\u2014constrained to assure her of my surprise. I had expected that
        Mr. Gatsby would be a florid and corpulent person in his middle years. \u201CWho
        is he?\u201D I demanded. \u201CDo you know?\u201D \u201CHe\u2019s just a
        man named Gatsby.\u201D \u201CWhere is he from, I mean? And what does he
        do?\u201D \u201CNow you\u2019re started on the subject,\u201D she answered
        with a wan smile. \u201CWell, he told me once he was an Oxford man.\u201D
        A dim background started to take shape behind him, but at her next remark
        it faded away. \u201CHowever, I don\u2019t believe it.\u201D \u201CWhy not?\u201D
        \u201CI don\u2019t know,\u201D she insisted, \u201CI just don\u2019t think
        he went there.\u201D Something in her tone reminded me of the other girl\u2019s
        \u201CI think he killed a man,\u201D and had the effect of stimulating my
        curiosity. I would have accepted without question the information that Gatsby
        sprang from the swamps of Louisiana or from the lower East Side of New York.
        That was comprehensible. But young men didn\u2019t\u2014at least in my provincial
        inexperience I believed they didn\u2019t\u2014drift coolly out of nowhere
        and buy a palace on Long Island Sound. \u201CAnyhow, he gives large parties,\u201D
        said Jordan, changing the subject with an urban distaste for the concrete.
        \u201CAnd I like large parties. They\u2019re so intimate. At small parties
        there isn\u2019t any privacy.\u201D There was the boom of a bass drum, and
        the voice of the orchestra leader rang out suddenly above the echolalia of
        the garden. \u201CLadies and gentlemen,\u201D he cried. \u201CAt the request
        of Mr. Gatsby we are going to play for you Mr. Vladmir Tostoff\u2019s latest
        work, which attracted so much attention at Carnegie Hall last May. If you
        read the papers you know there was a big sensation.\u201D He smiled with
        jovial condescension, and added: \u201CSome sensation!\u201D Whereupon everybody
        laughed. \u201CThe piece is known,\u201D he concluded lustily, \u201Cas \u2018Vladmir
        Tostoff\u2019s Jazz History of the World!\u2019\u200A\u201D The nature of
        Mr. Tostoff\u2019s composition eluded me, because just as it began my eyes
        fell on Gatsby, standing alone on the marble steps and looking from one group
        to another with approving eyes. His tanned skin was drawn attractively tight
        on his face and his short hair looked as though it were trimmed every day.
        I could see nothing sinister about him. I wondered if the fact that he was
        not drinking helped to set him off from his guests, for it seemed to me that
        he grew more correct as the fraternal hilarity increased. When the \u201CJazz
        History of the World\u201D was over, girls were putting their heads on men\u2019s
        shoulders in a puppyish, convivial way, girls were swooning backward playfully
        into men\u2019s arms, even into groups, knowing that someone would arrest
        their falls\u2014but no one swooned backward on Gatsby, and no French bob
        touched Gatsby\u2019s shoulder, and no singing quartets were formed with
        Gatsby\u2019s head for one link. \u201CI beg your pardon.\u201D Gatsby\u2019s
        butler was suddenly standing beside us. \u201CMiss Baker?\u201D he inquired.
        \u201CI beg your pardon, but Mr. Gatsby would like to speak to you alone.\u201D
        \u201CWith me?\u201D she exclaimed in surprise. \u201CYes, madame.\u201D
        She got up slowly, raising her eyebrows at me in astonishment, and followed
        the butler toward the house. I noticed that she wore her evening-dress, all
        her dresses, like sports clothes\u2014there was a jauntiness about her movements
        as if she had first learned to walk upon golf courses on clean, crisp mornings.
        I was alone and it was almost two. For some time confused and intriguing
        sounds had issued from a long, many-windowed room which overhung the terrace.
        Eluding Jordan\u2019s undergraduate, who was now engaged in an obstetrical
        conversation with two chorus girls, and who implored me to join him, I went
        inside. The large room was full of people. One of the girls in yellow was
        playing the piano, and beside her stood a tall, red-haired young lady from
        a famous chorus, engaged in song. She had drunk a quantity of champagne,
        and during the course of her song she had decided, ineptly, that everything
        was very, very sad\u2014she was not only singing, she was weeping too. Whenever
        there was a pause in the song she filled it with gasping, broken sobs, and
        then took up the lyric again in a quavering soprano. The tears coursed down
        her cheeks\u2014not freely, however, for when they came into contact with
        her heavily beaded eyelashes they assumed an inky colour, and pursued the
        rest of their way in slow black rivulets. A humorous suggestion was made
        that she sing the notes on her face, whereupon she threw up her hands, sank
        into a chair, and went off into a deep vinous sleep. \u201CShe had a fight
        with a man who says he\u2019s her husband,\u201D explained a girl at my elbow.
        I looked around. Most of the remaining women were now having fights with
        men said to be their husbands. Even Jordan\u2019s party, the quartet from
        East Egg, were rent asunder by dissension. One of the men was talking with
        curious intensity to a young actress, and his wife, after attempting to laugh
        at the situation in a dignified and indifferent way, broke down entirely
        and resorted to flank attacks\u2014at intervals she appeared suddenly at
        his side like an angry diamond, and hissed: \u201CYou promised!\u201D into
        his ear. The reluctance to go home was not confined to wayward men. The hall
        was at present occupied by two deplorably sober men and their highly indignant
        wives. The wives were sympathizing with each other in slightly raised voices.
        \u201CWhenever he sees I\u2019m having a good time he wants to go home.\u201D
        \u201CNever heard anything so selfish in my life.\u201D \u201CWe\u2019re
        always the first ones to leave.\u201D \u201CSo are we.\u201D \u201CWell,
        we\u2019re almost the last tonight,\u201D said one of the men sheepishly.
        \u201CThe orchestra left half an hour ago.\u201D In spite of the wives\u2019
        agreement that such malevolence was beyond credibility, the dispute ended
        in a short struggle, and both wives were lifted, kicking, into the night.
        As I waited for my hat in the hall the door of the library opened and Jordan
        Baker and Gatsby came out together. He was saying some last word to her,
        but the eagerness in his manner tightened abruptly into formality as several
        people approached him to say goodbye. Jordan\u2019s party were calling impatiently
        to her from the porch, but she lingered for a moment to shake hands. \u201CI\u2019ve
        just heard the most amazing thing,\u201D she whispered. \u201CHow long were
        we in there?\u201D \u201CWhy, about an hour.\u201D \u201CIt was\u2026 simply
        amazing,\u201D she repeated abstractedly. \u201CBut I swore I wouldn\u2019t
        tell it and here I am tantalizing you.\u201D She yawned gracefully in my
        face. \u201CPlease come and see me\u2026 Phone book\u2026 Under the name
        of Mrs. Sigourney Howard\u2026 My aunt\u2026\u201D She was hurrying off as
        she talked\u2014her brown hand waved a jaunty salute as she melted into her
        party at the door. Rather ashamed that on my first appearance I had stayed
        so late, I joined the last of Gatsby\u2019s guests, who were clustered around
        him. I wanted to explain that I\u2019d hunted for him early in the evening
        and to apologize for not having known him in the garden. \u201CDon\u2019t
        mention it,\u201D he enjoined me eagerly. \u201CDon\u2019t give it another
        thought, old sport.\u201D The familiar expression held no more familiarity
        than the hand which reassuringly brushed my shoulder. \u201CAnd don\u2019t
        forget we\u2019re going up in the hydroplane tomorrow morning, at nine o\u2019clock.\u201D
        Then the butler, behind his shoulder: \u201CPhiladelphia wants you on the
        phone, sir.\u201D \u201CAll right, in a minute. Tell them I\u2019ll be right
        there\u2026 Good night.\u201D \u201CGood night.\u201D \u201CGood night.\u201D
        He smiled\u2014and suddenly there seemed to be a pleasant significance in
        having been among the last to go, as if he had desired it all the time. \u201CGood
        night, old sport\u2026 Good night.\u201D But as I walked down the steps I
        saw that the evening was not quite over. Fifty feet from the door a dozen
        headlights illuminated a bizarre and tumultuous scene. In the ditch beside
        the road, right side up, but violently shorn of one wheel, rested a new coup\xE9
        which had left Gatsby\u2019s drive not two minutes before. The sharp jut
        of a wall accounted for the detachment of the wheel, which was now getting
        considerable attention from half a dozen curious chauffeurs. However, as
        they had left their cars blocking the road, a harsh, discordant din from
        those in the rear had been audible for some time, and added to the already
        violent confusion of the scene. A man in a long duster had dismounted from
        the wreck and now stood in the middle of the road, looking from the car to
        the tyre and from the tyre to the observers in a pleasant, puzzled way. \u201CSee!\u201D
        he explained. \u201CIt went in the ditch.\u201D The fact was infinitely astonishing
        to him, and I recognized first the unusual quality of wonder, and then the
        man\u2014it was the late patron of Gatsby\u2019s library. \u201CHow\u2019d
        it happen?\u201D He shrugged his shoulders. \u201CI know nothing whatever
        about mechanics,\u201D he said decisively. \u201CBut how did it happen? Did
        you run into the wall?\u201D \u201CDon\u2019t ask me,\u201D said Owl Eyes,
        washing his hands of the whole matter. \u201CI know very little about driving\u2014next
        to nothing. It happened, and that\u2019s all I know.\u201D \u201CWell, if
        you\u2019re a poor driver you oughtn\u2019t to try driving at night.\u201D
        \u201CBut I wasn\u2019t even trying,\u201D he explained indignantly, \u201CI
        wasn\u2019t even trying.\u201D An awed hush fell upon the bystanders. \u201CDo
        you want to commit suicide?\u201D \u201CYou\u2019re lucky it was just a wheel!
        A bad driver and not even trying!\u201D \u201CYou don\u2019t understand,\u201D
        explained the criminal. \u201CI wasn\u2019t driving. There\u2019s another
        man in the car.\u201D The shock that followed this declaration found voice
        in a sustained \u201CAh-h-h!\u201D as the door of the coup\xE9 swung slowly
        open. The crowd\u2014it was now a crowd\u2014stepped back involuntarily,
        and when the door had opened wide there was a ghostly pause. Then, very gradually,
        part by part, a pale, dangling individual stepped out of the wreck, pawing
        tentatively at the ground with a large uncertain dancing shoe. Blinded by
        the glare of the headlights and confused by the incessant groaning of the
        horns, the apparition stood swaying for a moment before he perceived the
        man in the duster. \u201CWha\u2019s matter?\u201D he inquired calmly. \u201CDid
        we run outa gas?\u201D \u201CLook!\u201D Half a dozen fingers pointed at
        the amputated wheel\u2014he stared at it for a moment, and then looked upward
        as though he suspected that it had dropped from the sky. \u201CIt came off,\u201D
        someone explained. He nodded. \u201CAt first I din\u2019 notice we\u2019d
        stopped.\u201D A pause. Then, taking a long breath and straightening his
        shoulders, he remarked in a determined voice: \u201CWonder\u2019ff tell me
        where there\u2019s a gas\u2019line station?\u201D At least a dozen men, some
        of them a little better off than he was, explained to him that wheel and
        car were no longer joined by any physical bond. \u201CBack out,\u201D he
        suggested after a moment. \u201CPut her in reverse.\u201D \u201CBut the wheel\u2019s
        off!\u201D He hesitated. \u201CNo harm in trying,\u201D he said. The caterwauling
        horns had reached a crescendo and I turned away and cut across the lawn toward
        home. I glanced back once. A wafer of a moon was shining over Gatsby\u2019s
        house, making the night fine as before, and surviving the laughter and the
        sound of his still glowing garden. A sudden emptiness seemed to flow now
        from the windows and the great doors, endowing with complete isolation the
        figure of the host, who stood on the porch, his hand up in a formal gesture
        of farewell. **********Reading over what I have written so far, I see I have
        given the impression that the events of three nights several weeks apart
        were all that absorbed me. On the contrary, they were merely casual events
        in a crowded summer, and, until much later, they absorbed me infinitely less
        than my personal affairs. Most of the time I worked. In the early morning
        the sun threw my shadow westward as I hurried down the white chasms of lower
        New York to the Probity Trust. I knew the other clerks and young bond-salesmen
        by their first names, and lunched with them in dark, crowded restaurants
        on little pig sausages and mashed potatoes and coffee. I even had a short
        affair with a girl who lived in Jersey City and worked in the accounting
        department, but her brother began throwing mean looks in my direction, so
        when she went on her vacation in July I let it blow quietly away. I took
        dinner usually at the Yale Club\u2014for some reason it was the gloomiest
        event of my day\u2014and then I went upstairs to the library and studied
        investments and securities for a conscientious hour. There were generally
        a few rioters around, but they never came into the library, so it was a good
        place to work. After that, if the night was mellow, I strolled down Madison
        Avenue past the old Murray Hill Hotel, and over 33rd Street to the Pennsylvania
        Station. I began to like New York, the racy, adventurous feel of it at night,
        and the satisfaction that the constant flicker of men and women and machines
        gives to the restless eye. I liked to walk up Fifth Avenue and pick out romantic
        women from the crowd and imagine that in a few minutes I was going to enter
        into their lives, and no one would ever know or disapprove. Sometimes, in
        my mind, I followed them to their apartments on the corners of hidden streets,
        and they turned and smiled back at me before they faded through a door into
        warm darkness. At the enchanted metropolitan twilight I felt a haunting loneliness
        sometimes, and felt it in others\u2014poor young clerks who loitered in front
        of windows waiting until it was time for a solitary restaurant dinner\u2014young
        clerks in the dusk, wasting the most poignant moments of night and life.
        Again at eight o\u2019clock, when the dark lanes of the Forties were lined
        five deep with throbbing taxicabs, bound for the theatre district, I felt
        a sinking in my heart. Forms leaned together in the taxis as they waited,
        and voices sang, and there was laughter from unheard jokes, and lighted cigarettes
        made unintelligible circles inside. Imagining that I, too, was hurrying towards
        gaiety and sharing their intimate excitement, I wished them well. For a while
        I lost sight of Jordan Baker, and then in midsummer I found her again. At
        first I was flattered to go places with her, because she was a golf champion,
        and everyone knew her name. Then it was something more. I wasn\u2019t actually
        in love, but I felt a sort of tender curiosity. The bored haughty face that
        she turned to the world concealed something\u2014most affectations conceal
        something eventually, even though they don\u2019t in the beginning\u2014and
        one day I found what it was. When we were on a house-party together up in
        Warwick, she left a borrowed car out in the rain with the top down, and then
        lied about it\u2014and suddenly I remembered the story about her that had
        eluded me that night at Daisy\u2019s. At her first big golf tournament there
        was a row that nearly reached the newspapers\u2014a suggestion that she had
        moved her ball from a bad lie in the semifinal round. The thing approached
        the proportions of a scandal\u2014then died away. A caddy retracted his statement,
        and the only other witness admitted that he might have been mistaken. The
        incident and the name had remained together in my mind. Jordan Baker instinctively
        avoided clever, shrewd men, and now I saw that this was because she felt
        safer on a plane where any divergence from a code would be thought impossible.
        She was incurably dishonest. She wasn\u2019t able to endure being at a disadvantage
        and, given this unwillingness, I suppose she had begun dealing in subterfuges
        when she was very young in order to keep that cool, insolent smile turned
        to the world and yet satisfy the demands of her hard, jaunty body. It made
        no difference to me. Dishonesty in a woman is a thing you never blame deeply\u2014I
        was casually sorry, and then I forgot. It was on that same house-party that
        we had a curious conversation about driving a car. It started because she
        passed so close to some workmen that our fender flicked a button on one man\u2019s
        coat. \u201CYou\u2019re a rotten driver,\u201D I protested. \u201CEither
        you ought to be more careful, or you oughtn\u2019t to drive at all.\u201D
        \u201CI am careful.\u201D \u201CNo, you\u2019re not.\u201D \u201CWell, other
        people are,\u201D she said lightly. \u201CWhat\u2019s that got to do with
        it?\u201D \u201CThey\u2019ll keep out of my way,\u201D she insisted. \u201CIt
        takes two to make an accident.\u201D \u201CSuppose you met somebody just
        as careless as yourself.\u201D \u201CI hope I never will,\u201D she answered.
        \u201CI hate careless people. That\u2019s why I like you.\u201D Her grey,
        sun-strained eyes stared straight ahead, but she had deliberately shifted
        our relations, and for a moment I thought I loved her. But I am slow-thinking
        and full of interior rules that act as brakes on my desires, and I knew that
        first I had to get myself definitely out of that tangle back home. I\u2019d
        been writing letters once a week and signing them: \u201CLove, Nick,\u201D
        and all I could think of was how, when that certain girl played tennis, a
        faint moustache of perspiration appeared on her upper lip. Nevertheless there
        was a vague understanding that had to be tactfully broken off before I was
        free. Everyone suspects himself of at least one of the cardinal virtues,
        and this is mine: I am one of the few honest people that I have ever known."
