      value: "After eating we crept back to the scullery, and there I must have dozed
        again, for when presently I looked round I was alone. The thudding vibration
        continued with wearisome persistence. I whispered for the curate several
        times, and at last felt my way to the door of the kitchen. It was still daylight,
        and I perceived him across the room, lying against the triangular hole that
        looked out upon the Martians. His shoulders were hunched, so that his head
        was hidden from me. I could hear a number of noises almost like those in
        an engine shed; and the place rocked with that beating thud. Through the
        aperture in the wall I could see the top of a tree touched with gold and
        the warm blue of a tranquil evening sky. For a minute or so I remained watching
        the curate, and then I advanced, crouching and stepping with extreme care
        amid the broken crockery that littered the floor. I touched the curate\u2019s
        leg, and he started so violently that a mass of plaster went sliding down
        outside and fell with a loud impact. I gripped his arm, fearing he might
        cry out, and for a long time we crouched motionless. Then I turned to see
        how much of our rampart remained. The detachment of the plaster had left
        a vertical slit open in the debris, and by raising myself cautiously across
        a beam I was able to see out of this gap into what had been overnight a quiet
        suburban roadway. Vast, indeed, was the change that we beheld. The fifth
        cylinder must have fallen right into the midst of the house we had first
        visited. The building had vanished, completely smashed, pulverised, and dispersed
        by the blow. The cylinder lay now far beneath the original foundations\u2014deep
        in a hole, already vastly larger than the pit I had looked into at Woking.
        The earth all round it had splashed under that tremendous impact\u2014\u201Csplashed\u201D
        is the only word\u2014and lay in heaped piles that hid the masses of the
        adjacent houses. It had behaved exactly like mud under the violent blow of
        a hammer. Our house had collapsed backward; the front portion, even on the
        ground floor, had been destroyed completely; by a chance the kitchen and
        scullery had escaped, and stood buried now under soil and ruins, closed in
        by tons of earth on every side save towards the cylinder. Over that aspect
        we hung now on the very edge of the great circular pit the Martians were
        engaged in making. The heavy beating sound was evidently just behind us,
        and ever and again a bright green vapour drove up like a veil across our
        peephole. The cylinder was already opened in the centre of the pit, and on
        the farther edge of the pit, amid the smashed and gravel-heaped shrubbery,
        one of the great fighting-machines, deserted by its occupant, stood stiff
        and tall against the evening sky. At first I scarcely noticed the pit and
        the cylinder, although it has been convenient to describe them first, on
        account of the extraordinary glittering mechanism I saw busy in the excavation,
        and on account of the strange creatures that were crawling slowly and painfully
        across the heaped mould near it. The mechanism it certainly was that held
        my attention first. It was one of those complicated fabrics that have since
        been called handling-machines, and the study of which has already given such
        an enormous impetus to terrestrial invention. As it dawned upon me first,
        it presented a sort of metallic spider with five jointed, agile legs, and
        with an extraordinary number of jointed levers, bars, and reaching and clutching
        tentacles about its body. Most of its arms were retracted, but with three
        long tentacles it was fishing out a number of rods, plates, and bars which
        lined the covering and apparently strengthened the walls of the cylinder.
        These, as it extracted them, were lifted out and deposited upon a level surface
        of earth behind it. Its motion was so swift, complex, and perfect that at
        first I did not see it as a machine, in spite of its metallic glitter. The
        fighting-machines were coordinated and animated to an extraordinary pitch,
        but nothing to compare with this. People who have never seen these structures,
        and have only the ill-imagined efforts of artists or the imperfect descriptions
        of such eye-witnesses as myself to go upon, scarcely realise that living
        quality. I recall particularly the illustration of one of the first pamphlets
        to give a consecutive account of the war. The artist had evidently made a
        hasty study of one of the fighting-machines, and there his knowledge ended.
        He presented them as tilted, stiff tripods, without either flexibility or
        subtlety, and with an altogether misleading monotony of effect. The pamphlet
        containing these renderings had a considerable vogue, and I mention them
        here simply to warn the reader against the impression they may have created.
        They were no more like the Martians I saw in action than a Dutch doll is
        like a human being. To my mind, the pamphlet would have been much better
        without them. At first, I say, the handling-machine did not impress me as
        a machine, but as a crablike creature with a glittering integument, the controlling
        Martian whose delicate tentacles actuated its movements seeming to be simply
        the equivalent of the crab\u2019s cerebral portion. But then I perceived
        the resemblance of its grey-brown, shiny, leathery integument to that of
        the other sprawling bodies beyond, and the true nature of this dexterous
        workman dawned upon me. With that realisation my interest shifted to those
        other creatures, the real Martians. Already I had had a transient impression
        of these, and the first nausea no longer obscured my observation. Moreover,
        I was concealed and motionless, and under no urgency of action. They were,
        I now saw, the most unearthly creatures it is possible to conceive. They
        were huge round bodies\u2014or, rather, heads\u2014about four feet in diameter,
        each body having in front of it a face. This face had no nostrils\u2014indeed,
        the Martians do not seem to have had any sense of smell, but it had a pair
        of very large dark-coloured eyes, and just beneath this a kind of fleshy
        beak. In the back of this head or body\u2014I scarcely know how to speak
        of it\u2014was the single tight tympanic surface, since known to be anatomically
        an ear, though it must have been almost useless in our dense air. In a group
        round the mouth were sixteen slender, almost whiplike tentacles, arranged
        in two bunches of eight each. These bunches have since been named rather
        aptly, by that distinguished anatomist, Professor Howes, the hands. Even
        as I saw these Martians for the first time they seemed to be endeavouring
        to raise themselves on these hands, but of course, with the increased weight
        of terrestrial conditions, this was impossible. There is reason to suppose
        that on Mars they may have progressed upon them with some facility. The internal
        anatomy, I may remark here, as dissection has since shown, was almost equally
        simple. The greater part of the structure was the brain, sending enormous
        nerves to the eyes, ear, and tactile tentacles. Besides this were the bulky
        lungs, into which the mouth opened, and the heart and its vessels. The pulmonary
        distress caused by the denser atmosphere and greater gravitational attraction
        was only too evident in the convulsive movements of the outer skin. And this
        was the sum of the Martian organs. Strange as it may seem to a human being,
        all the complex apparatus of digestion, which makes up the bulk of our bodies,
        did not exist in the Martians. They were heads\u2014merely heads. Entrails
        they had none. They did not eat, much less digest. Instead, they took the
        fresh, living blood of other creatures, and injected it into their own veins.
        I have myself seen this being done, as I shall mention in its place. But,
        squeamish as I may seem, I cannot bring myself to describe what I could not
        endure even to continue watching. Let it suffice to say, blood obtained from
        a still living animal, in most cases from a human being, was run directly
        by means of a little pipette into the recipient canal. . . . The bare idea
        of this is no doubt horribly repulsive to us, but at the same time I think
        that we should remember how repulsive our carnivorous habits would seem to
        an intelligent rabbit. The physiological advantages of the practice of injection
        are undeniable, if one thinks of the tremendous waste of human time and energy
        occasioned by eating and the digestive process. Our bodies are half made
        up of glands and tubes and organs, occupied in turning heterogeneous food
        into blood. The digestive processes and their reaction upon the nervous system
        sap our strength and colour our minds. Men go happy or miserable as they
        have healthy or unhealthy livers, or sound gastric glands. But the Martians
        were lifted above all these organic fluctuations of mood and emotion. Their
        undeniable preference for men as their source of nourishment is partly explained
        by the nature of the remains of the victims they had brought with them as
        provisions from Mars. These creatures, to judge from the shrivelled remains
        that have fallen into human hands, were bipeds with flimsy, silicious skeletons
        (almost like those of the silicious sponges) and feeble musculature, standing
        about six feet high and having round, erect heads, and large eyes in flinty
        sockets. Two or three of these seem to have been brought in each cylinder,
        and all were killed before earth was reached. It was just as well for them,
        for the mere attempt to stand upright upon our planet would have broken every
        bone in their bodies. And while I am engaged in this description, I may add
        in this place certain further details which, although they were not all evident
        to us at the time, will enable the reader who is unacquainted with them to
        form a clearer picture of these offensive creatures. In three other points
        their physiology differed strangely from ours. Their organisms did not sleep,
        any more than the heart of man sleeps. Since they had no extensive muscular
        mechanism to recuperate, that periodical extinction was unknown to them.
        They had little or no sense of fatigue, it would seem. On earth they could
        never have moved without effort, yet even to the last they kept in action.
        In twenty-four hours they did twenty-four hours of work, as even on earth
        is perhaps the case with the ants. In the next place, wonderful as it seems
        in a sexual world, the Martians were absolutely without sex, and therefore
        without any of the tumultuous emotions that arise from that difference among
        men. A young Martian, there can now be no dispute, was really born upon earth
        during the war, and it was found attached to its parent, partially budded
        off, just as young lilybulbs bud off, or like the young animals in the fresh-water
        polyp. In man, in all the higher terrestrial animals, such a method of increase
        has disappeared; but even on this earth it was certainly the primitive method.
        Among the lower animals, up even to those first cousins of the vertebrated
        animals, the Tunicates, the two processes occur side by side, but finally
        the sexual method superseded its competitor altogether. On Mars, however,
        just the reverse has apparently been the case. It is worthy of remark that
        a certain speculative writer of quasi-scientific repute, writing long before
        the Martian invasion, did forecast for man a final structure not unlike the
        actual Martian condition. His prophecy, I remember, appeared in November
        or December, 1893, in a long-defunct publication, the Pall Mall Budget, and
        I recall a caricature of it in a pre-Martian periodical called Punch. He
        pointed out\u2014writing in a foolish, facetious tone\u2014that the perfection
        of mechanical appliances must ultimately supersede limbs; the perfection
        of chemical devices, digestion; that such organs as hair, external nose,
        teeth, ears, and chin were no longer essential parts of the human being,
        and that the tendency of natural selection would lie in the direction of
        their steady diminution through the coming ages. The brain alone remained
        a cardinal necessity. Only one other part of the body had a strong case for
        survival, and that was the hand, \u201Cteacher and agent of the brain.\u201D
        While the rest of the body dwindled, the hands would grow larger. There is
        many a true word written in jest, and here in the Martians we have beyond
        dispute the actual accomplishment of such a suppression of the animal side
        of the organism by the intelligence. To me it is quite credible that the
        Martians may be descended from beings not unlike ourselves, by a gradual
        development of brain and hands (the latter giving rise to the two bunches
        of delicate tentacles at last) at the expense of the rest of the body. Without
        the body the brain would, of course, become a mere selfish intelligence,
        without any of the emotional substratum of the human being. The last salient
        point in which the systems of these creatures differed from ours was in what
        one might have thought a very trivial particular. Micro-organisms, which
        cause so much disease and pain on earth, have either never appeared upon
        Mars or Martian sanitary science eliminated them ages ago. A hundred diseases,
        all the fevers and contagions of human life, consumption, cancers, tumours
        and such morbidities, never enter the scheme of their life. And speaking
        of the differences between the life on Mars and terrestrial life, I may allude
        here to the curious suggestions of the red weed. Apparently the vegetable
        kingdom in Mars, instead of having green for a dominant colour, is of a vivid
        blood-red tint. At any rate, the seeds which the Martians (intentionally
        or accidentally) brought with them gave rise in all cases to red-coloured
        growths. Only that known popularly as the red weed, however, gained any footing
        in competition with terrestrial forms. The red creeper was quite a transitory
        growth, and few people have seen it growing. For a time, however, the red
        weed grew with astonishing vigour and luxuriance. It spread up the sides
        of the pit by the third or fourth day of our imprisonment, and its cactus-like
        branches formed a carmine fringe to the edges of our triangular window. And
        afterwards I found it broadcast throughout the country, and especially wherever
        there was a stream of water. The Martians had what appears to have been an
        auditory organ, a single round drum at the back of the head-body, and eyes
        with a visual range not very different from ours except that, according to
        Philips, blue and violet were as black to them. It is commonly supposed that
        they communicated by sounds and tentacular gesticulations; this is asserted,
        for instance, in the able but hastily compiled pamphlet (written evidently
        by someone not an eye-witness of Martian actions) to which I have already
        alluded, and which, so far, has been the chief source of information concerning
        them. Now no surviving human being saw so much of the Martians in action
        as I did. I take no credit to myself for an accident, but the fact is so.
        And I assert that I watched them closely time after time, and that I have
        seen four, five, and (once) six of them sluggishly performing the most elaborately
        complicated operations together without either sound or gesture. Their peculiar
        hooting invariably preceded feeding; it had no modulation, and was, I believe,
        in no sense a signal, but merely the expiration of air preparatory to the
        suctional operation. I have a certain claim to at least an elementary knowledge
        of psychology, and in this matter I am convinced\u2014as firmly as I am convinced
        of anything\u2014that the Martians interchanged thoughts without any physical
        intermediation. And I have been convinced of this in spite of strong preconceptions.
        Before the Martian invasion, as an occasional reader here or there may remember,
        I had written with some little vehemence against the telepathic theory. The
        Martians wore no clothing. Their conceptions of ornament and decorum were
        necessarily different from ours; and not only were they evidently much less
        sensible of changes of temperature than we are, but changes of pressure do
        not seem to have affected their health at all seriously. Yet though they
        wore no clothing, it was in the other artificial additions to their bodily
        resources that their great superiority over man lay. We men, with our bicycles
        and road-skates, our Lilienthal soaring-machines, our guns and sticks and
        so forth, are just in the beginning of the evolution that the Martians have
        worked out. They have become practically mere brains, wearing different bodies
        according to their needs just as men wear suits of clothes and take a bicycle
        in a hurry or an umbrella in the wet. And of their appliances, perhaps nothing
        is more wonderful to a man than the curious fact that what is the dominant
        feature of almost all human devices in mechanism is absent\u2014the wheel
        is absent; among all the things they brought to earth there is no trace or
        suggestion of their use of wheels. One would have at least expected it in
        locomotion. And in this connection it is curious to remark that even on this
        earth Nature has never hit upon the wheel, or has preferred other expedients
        to its development. And not only did the Martians either not know of (which
        is incredible), or abstain from, the wheel, but in their apparatus singularly
        little use is made of the fixed pivot or relatively fixed pivot, with circular
        motions thereabout confined to one plane. Almost all the joints of the machinery
        present a complicated system of sliding parts moving over small but beautifully
        curved friction bearings. And while upon this matter of detail, it is remarkable
        that the long leverages of their machines are in most cases actuated by a
        sort of sham musculature of the disks in an elastic sheath; these disks become
        polarised and drawn closely and powerfully together when traversed by a current
        of electricity. In this way the curious parallelism to animal motions, which
        was so striking and disturbing to the human beholder, was attained. Such
        quasi-muscles abounded in the crablike handling-machine which, on my first
        peeping out of the slit, I watched unpacking the cylinder. It seemed infinitely
        more alive than the actual Martians lying beyond it in the sunset light,
        panting, stirring ineffectual tentacles, and moving feebly after their vast
        journey across space. While I was still watching their sluggish motions in
        the sunlight, and noting each strange detail of their form, the curate reminded
        me of his presence by pulling violently at my arm. I turned to a scowling
        face, and silent, eloquent lips. He wanted the slit, which permitted only
        one of us to peep through; and so I had to forego watching them for a time
        while he enjoyed that privilege. When I looked again, the busy handling-machine
        had already put together several of the pieces of apparatus it had taken
        out of the cylinder into a shape having an unmistakable likeness to its own;
        and down on the left a busy little digging mechanism had come into view,
        emitting jets of green vapour and working its way round the pit, excavating
        and embanking in a methodical and discriminating manner. This it was which
        had caused the regular beating noise, and the rhythmic shocks that had kept
        our ruinous refuge quivering. It piped and whistled as it worked. So far
        as I could see, the thing was without a directing Martian at all."
