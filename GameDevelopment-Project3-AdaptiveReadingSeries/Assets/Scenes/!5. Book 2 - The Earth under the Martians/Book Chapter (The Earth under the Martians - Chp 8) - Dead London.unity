      value: "After I had parted from the artilleryman, I went down the hill, and
        by the High Street across the bridge to Fulham. The red weed was tumultuous
        at that time, and nearly choked the bridge roadway; but its fronds were already
        whitened in patches by the spreading disease that presently removed it so
        swiftly. At the corner of the lane that runs to Putney Bridge station I found
        a man lying. He was as black as a sweep with the black dust, alive, but helplessly
        and speechlessly drunk. I could get nothing from him but curses and furious
        lunges at my head. I think I should have stayed by him but for the brutal
        expression of his face. There was black dust along the roadway from the bridge
        onwards, and it grew thicker in Fulham. The streets were horribly quiet.
        I got food\u2014sour, hard, and mouldy, but quite eatable\u2014in a baker\u2019s
        shop here. Some way towards Walham Green the streets became clear of powder,
        and I passed a white terrace of houses on fire; the noise of the burning
        was an absolute relief. Going on towards Brompton, the streets were quiet
        again. Here I came once more upon the black powder in the streets and upon
        dead bodies. I saw altogether about a dozen in the length of the Fulham Road.
        They had been dead many days, so that I hurried quickly past them. The black
        powder covered them over, and softened their outlines. One or two had been
        disturbed by dogs. Where there was no black powder, it was curiously like
        a Sunday in the City, with the closed shops, the houses locked up and the
        blinds drawn, the desertion, and the stillness. In some places plunderers
        had been at work, but rarely at other than the provision and wine shops.
        A jeweller\u2019s window had been broken open in one place, but apparently
        the thief had been disturbed, and a number of gold chains and a watch lay
        scattered on the pavement. I did not trouble to touch them. Farther on was
        a tattered woman in a heap on a doorstep; the hand that hung over her knee
        was gashed and bled down her rusty brown dress, and a smashed magnum of champagne
        formed a pool across the pavement. She seemed asleep, but she was dead. The
        farther I penetrated into London, the profounder grew the stillness. But
        it was not so much the stillness of death\u2014it was the stillness of suspense,
        of expectation. At any time the destruction that had already singed the northwestern
        borders of the metropolis, and had annihilated Ealing and Kilburn, might
        strike among these houses and leave them smoking ruins. It was a city condemned
        and derelict. . . . In South Kensington the streets were clear of dead and
        of black powder. It was near South Kensington that I first heard the howling.
        It crept almost imperceptibly upon my senses. It was a sobbing alternation
        of two notes, \u201CUlla, ulla, ulla, ulla,\u201D keeping on perpetually.
        When I passed streets that ran northward it grew in volume, and houses and
        buildings seemed to deaden and cut it off again. It came in a full tide down
        Exhibition Road. I stopped, staring towards Kensington Gardens, wondering
        at this strange, remote wailing. It was as if that mighty desert of houses
        had found a voice for its fear and solitude. \u201CUlla, ulla, ulla, ulla,\u201D
        wailed that superhuman note\u2014great waves of sound sweeping down the broad,
        sunlit roadway, between the tall buildings on each side. I turned northwards,
        marvelling, towards the iron gates of Hyde Park. I had half a mind to break
        into the Natural History Museum and find my way up to the summits of the
        towers, in order to see across the park. But I decided to keep to the ground,
        where quick hiding was possible, and so went on up the Exhibition Road. All
        the large mansions on each side of the road were empty and still, and my
        footsteps echoed against the sides of the houses. At the top, near the park
        gate, I came upon a strange sight\u2014a bus overturned, and the skeleton
        of a horse picked clean. I puzzled over this for a time, and then went on
        to the bridge over the Serpentine. The voice grew stronger and stronger,
        though I could see nothing above the housetops on the north side of the park,
        save a haze of smoke to the northwest. \u201CUlla, ulla, ulla, ulla,\u201D
        cried the voice, coming, as it seemed to me, from the district about Regent\u2019s
        Park. The desolating cry worked upon my mind. The mood that had sustained
        me passed. The wailing took possession of me. I found I was intensely weary,
        footsore, and now again hungry and thirsty. It was already past noon. Why
        was I wandering alone in this city of the dead? Why was I alone when all
        London was lying in state, and in its black shroud? I felt intolerably lonely.
        My mind ran on old friends that I had forgotten for years. I thought of the
        poisons in the chemists\u2019 shops, of the liquors the wine merchants stored;
        I recalled the two sodden creatures of despair, who so far as I knew, shared
        the city with myself. . . . I came into Oxford Street by the Marble Arch,
        and here again were black powder and several bodies, and an evil, ominous
        smell from the gratings of the cellars of some of the houses. I grew very
        thirsty after the heat of my long walk. With infinite trouble I managed to
        break into a public-house and get food and drink. I was weary after eating,
        and went into the parlour behind the bar, and slept on a black horsehair
        sofa I found there. I awoke to find that dismal howling still in my ears,
        \u201CUlla, ulla, ulla, ulla.\u201D It was now dusk, and after I had routed
        out some biscuits and a cheese in the bar\u2014there was a meat safe, but
        it contained nothing but maggots\u2014I wandered on through the silent residential
        squares to Baker Street\u2014Portman Square is the only one I can name\u2014and
        so came out at last upon Regent\u2019s Park. And as I emerged from the top
        of Baker Street, I saw far away over the trees in the clearness of the sunset
        the hood of the Martian giant from which this howling proceeded. I was not
        terrified. I came upon him as if it were a matter of course. I watched him
        for some time, but he did not move. He appeared to be standing and yelling,
        for no reason that I could discover. I tried to formulate a plan of action.
        That perpetual sound of \u201CUlla, ulla, ulla, ulla,\u201D confused my mind.
        Perhaps I was too tired to be very fearful. Certainly I was more curious
        to know the reason of this monotonous crying than afraid. I turned back away
        from the park and struck into Park Road, intending to skirt the park, went
        along under the shelter of the terraces, and got a view of this stationary,
        howling Martian from the direction of St. John\u2019s Wood. A couple of hundred
        yards out of Baker Street I heard a yelping chorus, and saw, first a dog
        with a piece of putrescent red meat in his jaws coming headlong towards me,
        and then a pack of starving mongrels in pursuit of him. He made a wide curve
        to avoid me, as though he feared I might prove a fresh competitor. As the
        yelping died away down the silent road, the wailing sound of \u201CUlla,
        ulla, ulla, ulla,\u201D reasserted itself. I came upon the wrecked handling-machine
        halfway to St. John\u2019s Wood station. At first I thought a house had fallen
        across the road. It was only as I clambered among the ruins that I saw, with
        a start, this mechanical Samson lying, with its tentacles bent and smashed
        and twisted, among the ruins it had made. The forepart was shattered. It
        seemed as if it had driven blindly straight at the house, and had been overwhelmed
        in its overthrow. It seemed to me then that this might have happened by a
        handling-machine escaping from the guidance of its Martian. I could not clamber
        among the ruins to see it, and the twilight was now so far advanced that
        the blood with which its seat was smeared, and the gnawed gristle of the
        Martian that the dogs had left, were invisible to me. Wondering still more
        at all that I had seen, I pushed on towards Primrose Hill. Far away, through
        a gap in the trees, I saw a second Martian, as motionless as the first, standing
        in the park towards the Zoological Gardens, and silent. A little beyond the
        ruins about the smashed handling-machine I came upon the red weed again,
        and found the Regent\u2019s Canal, a spongy mass of dark-red vegetation.
        As I crossed the bridge, the sound of \u201CUlla, ulla, ulla, ulla,\u201D
        ceased. It was, as it were, cut off. The silence came like a thunderclap.
        The dusky houses about me stood faint and tall and dim; the trees towards
        the park were growing black. All about me the red weed clambered among the
        ruins, writhing to get above me in the dimness. Night, the mother of fear
        and mystery, was coming upon me. But while that voice sounded the solitude,
        the desolation, had been endurable; by virtue of it London had still seemed
        alive, and the sense of life about me had upheld me. Then suddenly a change,
        the passing of something\u2014I knew not what\u2014and then a stillness that
        could be felt. Nothing but this gaunt quiet. London about me gazed at me
        spectrally. The windows in the white houses were like the eye sockets of
        skulls. About me my imagination found a thousand noiseless enemies moving.
        Terror seized me, a horror of my temerity. In front of me the road became
        pitchy black as though it was tarred, and I saw a contorted shape lying across
        the pathway. I could not bring myself to go on. I turned down St. John\u2019s
        Wood Road, and ran headlong from this unendurable stillness towards Kilburn.
        I hid from the night and the silence, until long after midnight, in a cabmen\u2019s
        shelter in Harrow Road. But before the dawn my courage returned, and while
        the stars were still in the sky I turned once more towards Regent\u2019s
        Park. I missed my way among the streets, and presently saw down a long avenue,
        in the half-light of the early dawn, the curve of Primrose Hill. On the summit,
        towering up to the fading stars, was a third Martian, erect and motionless
        like the others. An insane resolve possessed me. I would die and end it.
        And I would save myself even the trouble of killing myself. I marched on
        recklessly towards this Titan, and then, as I drew nearer and the light grew,
        I saw that a multitude of black birds was circling and clustering about the
        hood. At that my heart gave a bound, and I began running along the road.
        I hurried through the red weed that choked St. Edmund\u2019s Terrace (I waded
        breast-high across a torrent of water that was rushing down from the waterworks
        towards the Albert Road), and emerged upon the grass before the rising of
        the sun. Great mounds had been heaped about the crest of the hill, making
        a huge redoubt of it\u2014it was the final and largest place the Martians
        had made\u2014and from behind these heaps there rose a thin smoke against
        the sky. Against the sky line an eager dog ran and disappeared. The thought
        that had flashed into my mind grew real, grew credible. I felt no fear, only
        a wild, trembling exultation, as I ran up the hill towards the motionless
        monster. Out of the hood hung lank shreds of brown, at which the hungry birds
        pecked and tore. In another moment I had scrambled up the earthen rampart
        and stood upon its crest, and the interior of the redoubt was below me. A
        mighty space it was, with gigantic machines here and there within it, huge
        mounds of material and strange shelter places. And scattered about it, some
        in their overturned war-machines, some in the now rigid handling-machines,
        and a dozen of them stark and silent and laid in a row, were the Martians\u2014dead!\u2014slain
        by the putrefactive and disease bacteria against which their systems were
        unprepared; slain as the red weed was being slain; slain, after all man\u2019s
        devices had failed, by the humblest things that God, in his wisdom, has put
        upon this earth. For so it had come about, as indeed I and many men might
        have foreseen had not terror and disaster blinded our minds. These germs
        of disease have taken toll of humanity since the beginning of things\u2014taken
        toll of our prehuman ancestors since life began here. But by virtue of this
        natural selection of our kind we have developed resisting power; to no germs
        do we succumb without a struggle, and to many\u2014those that cause putrefaction
        in dead matter, for instance\u2014our living frames are altogether immune.
        But there are no bacteria in Mars, and directly these invaders arrived, directly
        they drank and fed, our microscopic allies began to work their overthrow.
        Already when I watched them they were irrevocably doomed, dying and rotting
        even as they went to and fro. It was inevitable. By the toll of a billion
        deaths man has bought his birthright of the earth, and it is his against
        all comers; it would still be his were the Martians ten times as mighty as
        they are. For neither do men live nor die in vain. Here and there they were
        scattered, nearly fifty altogether, in that great gulf they had made, overtaken
        by a death that must have seemed to them as incomprehensible as any death
        could be. To me also at that time this death was incomprehensible. All I
        knew was that these things that had been alive and so terrible to men were
        dead. For a moment I believed that the destruction of Sennacherib had been
        repeated, that God had repented, that the Angel of Death had slain them in
        the night. I stood staring into the pit, and my heart lightened gloriously,
        even as the rising sun struck the world to fire about me with his rays. The
        pit was still in darkness; the mighty engines, so great and wonderful in
        their power and complexity, so unearthly in their tortuous forms, rose weird
        and vague and strange out of the shadows towards the light. A multitude of
        dogs, I could hear, fought over the bodies that lay darkly in the depth of
        the pit, far below me. Across the pit on its farther lip, flat and vast and
        strange, lay the great flying-machine with which they had been experimenting
        upon our denser atmosphere when decay and death arrested them. Death had
        come not a day too soon. At the sound of a cawing overhead I looked up at
        the huge fighting-machine that would fight no more for ever, at the tattered
        red shreds of flesh that dripped down upon the overturned seats on the summit
        of Primrose Hill. I turned and looked down the slope of the hill to where,
        enhaloed now in birds, stood those other two Martians that I had seen overnight,
        just as death had overtaken them. The one had died, even as it had been crying
        to its companions; perhaps it was the last to die, and its voice had gone
        on perpetually until the force of its machinery was exhausted. They glittered
        now, harmless tripod towers of shining metal, in the brightness of the rising
        sun. All about the pit, and saved as by a miracle from everlasting destruction,
        stretched the great Mother of Cities. Those who have only seen London veiled
        in her sombre robes of smoke can scarcely imagine the naked clearness and
        beauty of the silent wilderness of houses. Eastward, over the blackened ruins
        of the Albert Terrace and the splintered spire of the church, the sun blazed
        dazzling in a clear sky, and here and there some facet in the great wilderness
        of roofs caught the light and glared with a white intensity. Northward were
        Kilburn and Hampsted, blue and crowded with houses; westward the great city
        was dimmed; and southward, beyond the Martians, the green waves of Regent\u2019s
        Park, the Langham Hotel, the dome of the Albert Hall, the Imperial Institute,
        and the giant mansions of the Brompton Road came out clear and little in
        the sunrise, the jagged ruins of Westminster rising hazily beyond. Far away
        and blue were the Surrey hills, and the towers of the Crystal Palace glittered
        like two silver rods. The dome of St. Paul\u2019s was dark against the sunrise,
        and injured, I saw for the first time, by a huge gaping cavity on its western
        side. And as I looked at this wide expanse of houses and factories and churches,
        silent and abandoned; as I thought of the multitudinous hopes and efforts,
        the innumerable hosts of lives that had gone to build this human reef, and
        of the swift and ruthless destruction that had hung over it all; when I realised
        that the shadow had been rolled back, and that men might still live in the
        streets, and this dear vast dead city of mine be once more alive and powerful,
        I felt a wave of emotion that was near akin to tears. The torment was over.
        Even that day the healing would begin. The survivors of the people scattered
        over the country\u2014leaderless, lawless, foodless, like sheep without a
        shepherd\u2014the thousands who had fled by sea, would begin to return; the
        pulse of life, growing stronger and stronger, would beat again in the empty
        streets and pour across the vacant squares. Whatever destruction was done,
        the hand of the destroyer was stayed. All the gaunt wrecks, the blackened
        skeletons of houses that stared so dismally at the sunlit grass of the hill,
        would presently be echoing with the hammers of the restorers and ringing
        with the tapping of their trowels. At the thought I extended my hands towards
        the sky and began thanking God. In a year, thought I\u2014in a year. . .
        . With overwhelming force came the thought of myself, of my wife, and the
        old life of hope and tender helpfulness that had ceased for ever."
