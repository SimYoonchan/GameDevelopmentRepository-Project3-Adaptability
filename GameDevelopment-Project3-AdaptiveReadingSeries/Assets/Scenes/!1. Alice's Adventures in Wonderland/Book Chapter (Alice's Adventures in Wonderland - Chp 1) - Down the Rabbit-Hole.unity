      value: "Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the
        bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the
        book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it,
        \u201Cand what is the use of a book,\u201D thought Alice \u201Cwithout pictures
        or conversations?\u201D So she was considering in her own mind (as well as
        she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether
        the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting
        up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran
        close by her. There was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice
        think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, \u201COh
        dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!\u201D (when she thought it over afterwards,
        it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time
        it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually took a watch out
        of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started
        to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen
        a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and
        burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately
        was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.
        In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in
        the world she was to get out again. The rabbit-hole went straight on like
        a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice
        had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself
        falling down a very deep well. Either the well was very deep, or she fell
        very slowly, for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her
        and to wonder what was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down
        and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything;
        then she looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled
        with cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures
        hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed;
        it was labelled \u201CORANGE MARMALADE\u201D, but to her great disappointment
        it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody
        underneath, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past
        it. \u201CWell!\u201D thought Alice to herself, \u201Cafter such a fall as
        this, I shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they\u2019ll
        all think me at home! Why, I wouldn\u2019t say anything about it, even if
        I fell off the top of the house!\u201D (Which was very likely true.)Down,
        down, down. Would the fall never come to an end? \u201CI wonder how many
        miles I\u2019ve fallen by this time?\u201D she said aloud. \u201CI must be
        getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be
        four thousand miles down, I think\u2014\u201D (for, you see, Alice had learnt
        several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though
        this was not a very good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there
        was no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over) \u201C\u2014yes,
        that\u2019s about the right distance\u2014but then I wonder what Latitude
        or Longitude I\u2019ve got to?\u201D (Alice had no idea what Latitude was,
        or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to say.)Presently
        she began again. \u201CI wonder if I shall fall right through the earth!
        How funny it\u2019ll seem to come out among the people that walk with their
        heads downward! The Antipathies, I think\u2014\u201D (she was rather glad
        there was no one listening, this time, as it didn\u2019t sound at all the
        right word) \u201C\u2014but I shall have to ask them what the name of the
        country is, you know. Please, Ma\u2019am, is this New Zealand or Australia?\u201D
        (and she tried to curtsey as she spoke\u2014fancy curtseying as you\u2019re
        falling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) \u201CAnd what
        an ignorant little girl she\u2019ll think me for asking! No, it\u2019ll never
        do to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.\u201D Down, down,
        down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began talking again. \u201CDinah\u2019ll
        miss me very much to-night, I should think!\u201D (Dinah was the cat.) \u201CI
        hope they\u2019ll remember her saucer of milk at tea-time. Dinah my dear!
        I wish you were down here with me! There are no mice in the air, I\u2019m
        afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that\u2019s very like a mouse, you
        know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?\u201D And here Alice began to get rather
        sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of way, \u201CDo
        cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?\u201D and sometimes, \u201CDo bats eat cats?\u201D
        for, you see, as she couldn\u2019t answer either question, it didn\u2019t
        much matter which way she put it. She felt that she was dozing off, and had
        just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying
        to her very earnestly, \u201CNow, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever
        eat a bat?\u201D when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of
        sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over. Alice was not a bit hurt, and
        she jumped up on to her feet in a moment: she looked up, but it was all dark
        overhead; before her was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still
        in sight, hurrying down it. There was not a moment to be lost: away went
        Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a
        corner, \u201COh my ears and whiskers, how late it\u2019s getting!\u201D
        She was close behind it when she turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no
        longer to be seen: she found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up
        by a row of lamps hanging from the roof. There were doors all round the hall,
        but they were all locked; and when Alice had been all the way down one side
        and up the other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering
        how she was ever to get out again. Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged
        table, all made of solid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden
        key, and Alice\u2019s first thought was that it might belong to one of the
        doors of the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key
        was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on
        the second time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before,
        and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the
        little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted! Alice
        opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not much larger
        than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest
        garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander
        about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but she
        could not even get her head through the doorway; \u201Cand even if my head
        would go through,\u201D thought poor Alice, \u201Cit would be of very little
        use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I could shut up like a telescope!
        I think I could, if I only knew how to begin.\u201D For, you see, so many
        out-of-the-way things had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think
        that very few things indeed were really impossible. There seemed to be no
        use in waiting by the little door, so she went back to the table, half hoping
        she might find another key on it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting
        people up like telescopes: this time she found a little bottle on it, (\u201Cwhich
        certainly was not here before,\u201D said Alice,) and round the neck of the
        bottle was a paper label, with the words \u201CDRINK ME,\u201D beautifully
        printed on it in large letters. It was all very well to say \u201CDrink me,\u201D
        but the wise little Alice was not going to do that in a hurry. \u201CNo,
        I\u2019ll look first,\u201D she said, \u201Cand see whether it\u2019s marked
        \u2018poison\u2019 or not\u201D; for she had read several nice little histories
        about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant
        things, all because they would not remember the simple rules their friends
        had taught them: such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold
        it too long; and that if you cut your finger very deeply with a knife, it
        usually bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from
        a bottle marked \u201Cpoison,\u201D it is almost certain to disagree with
        you, sooner or later. However, this bottle was not marked \u201Cpoison,\u201D
        so Alice ventured to taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact,
        a sort of mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey,
        toffee, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off. **********\u201CWhat
        a curious feeling!\u201D said Alice; \u201CI must be shutting up like a telescope.\u201D
        And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face brightened
        up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little
        door into that lovely garden. First, however, she waited for a few minutes
        to see if she was going to shrink any further: she felt a little nervous
        about this; \u201Cfor it might end, you know,\u201D said Alice to herself,
        \u201Cin my going out altogether, like a candle. I wonder what I should be
        like then?\u201D And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like
        after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember ever having seen
        such a thing. After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided
        on going into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got
        to the door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when
        she went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach
        it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best
        to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery; and when
        she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and
        cried.\u201C Come, there\u2019s no use in crying like that!\u201D said Alice
        to herself, rather sharply; \u201CI advise you to leave off this minute!\u201D
        She generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed
        it), and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into
        her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated
        herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious
        child was very fond of pretending to be two people. \u201CBut it\u2019s no
        use now,\u201D thought poor Alice, \u201Cto pretend to be two people! Why,
        there\u2019s hardly enough of me left to make one respectable person!\u201D
        Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table: she
        opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words \u201CEAT
        ME\u201D were beautifully marked in currants. \u201CWell, I\u2019ll eat it,\u201D
        said Alice, \u201Cand if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and
        if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way I\u2019ll
        get into the garden, and I don\u2019t care which happens!\u201D She ate a
        little bit, and said anxiously to herself, \u201CWhich way? Which way?\u201D,
        holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing,
        and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size: to be
        sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice had got so much
        into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen, that
        it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way. So she
        set to work, and very soon finished off the cake."
