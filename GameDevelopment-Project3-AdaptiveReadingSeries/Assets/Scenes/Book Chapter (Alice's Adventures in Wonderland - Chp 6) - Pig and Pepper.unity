      value: "For a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and wondering what
        to do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the wood\u2014(she
        considered him to be a footman because he was in livery: otherwise, judging
        by his face only, she would have called him a fish)\u2014and rapped loudly
        at the door with his knuckles. It was opened by another footman in livery,
        with a round face, and large eyes like a frog; and both footmen, Alice noticed,
        had powdered hair that curled all over their heads. She felt very curious
        to know what it was all about, and crept a little way out of the wood to
        listen. The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter,
        nearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to the other, saying,
        in a solemn tone, \u201CFor the Duchess. An invitation from the Queen to
        play croquet.\u201D The Frog-Footman repeated, in the same solemn tone, only
        changing the order of the words a little, \u201CFrom the Queen. An invitation
        for the Duchess to play croquet.\u201D Then they both bowed low, and their
        curls got entangled together. Alice laughed so much at this, that she had
        to run back into the wood for fear of their hearing her; and when she next
        peeped out the Fish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the ground
        near the door, staring stupidly up into the sky. Alice went timidly up to
        the door, and knocked. \u201CThere\u2019s no sort of use in knocking,\u201D
        said the Footman, \u201Cand that for two reasons. First, because I\u2019m
        on the same side of the door as you are; secondly, because they\u2019re making
        such a noise inside, no one could possibly hear you.\u201D And certainly
        there was a most extraordinary noise going on within\u2014a constant howling
        and sneezing, and every now and then a great crash, as if a dish or kettle
        had been broken to pieces. \u201CPlease, then,\u201D said Alice, \u201Chow
        am I to get in?\u201D \u201CThere might be some sense in your knocking,\u201D
        the Footman went on without attending to her, \u201Cif we had the door between
        us. For instance, if you were inside, you might knock, and I could let you
        out, you know.\u201D He was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking,
        and this Alice thought decidedly uncivil. \u201CBut perhaps he can\u2019t
        help it,\u201D she said to herself; \u201Chis eyes are so very nearly at
        the top of his head. But at any rate he might answer questions.\u2014How
        am I to get in?\u201D she repeated, aloud. \u201CI shall sit here,\u201D
        the Footman remarked, \u201Ctill tomorrow\u2014\u201DAt this moment the door
        of the house opened, and a large plate came skimming out, straight at the
        Footman\u2019s head: it just grazed his nose, and broke to pieces against
        one of the trees behind him.\u201C\u2014or next day, maybe,\u201D the Footman
        continued in the same tone, exactly as if nothing had happened. \u201CHow
        am I to get in?\u201D asked Alice again, in a louder tone. \u201CAre you
        to get in at all?\u201D said the Footman. \u201CThat\u2019s the first question,
        you know.\u201D It was, no doubt: only Alice did not like to be told so.
        \u201CIt\u2019s really dreadful,\u201D she muttered to herself, \u201Cthe
        way all the creatures argue. It\u2019s enough to drive one crazy!\u201D The
        Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his remark,
        with variations. \u201CI shall sit here,\u201D he said, \u201Con and off,
        for days and days.\u201D \u201CBut what am I to do?\u201D said Alice. \u201CAnything
        you like,\u201D said the Footman, and began whistling. \u201COh, there\u2019s
        no use in talking to him,\u201D said Alice desperately: \u201Che\u2019s perfectly
        idiotic!\u201D And she opened the door and went in. The door led right into
        a large kitchen, which was full of smoke from one end to the other: the Duchess
        was sitting on a three-legged stool in the middle, nursing a baby; the cook
        was leaning over the fire, stirring a large cauldron which seemed to be full
        of soup. \u201CThere\u2019s certainly too much pepper in that soup!\u201D
        Alice said to herself, as well as she could for sneezing. There was certainly
        too much of it in the air. Even the Duchess sneezed occasionally; and as
        for the baby, it was sneezing and howling alternately without a moment\u2019s
        pause. The only things in the kitchen that did not sneeze, were the cook,
        and a large cat which was sitting on the hearth and grinning from ear to
        ear. \u201CPlease would you tell me,\u201D said Alice, a little timidly,
        for she was not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first,
        \u201Cwhy your cat grins like that?\u201D \u201CIt\u2019s a Cheshire cat,\u201D
        said the Duchess, \u201Cand that\u2019s why. Pig!\u201D She said the last
        word with such sudden violence that Alice quite jumped; but she saw in another
        moment that it was addressed to the baby, and not to her, so she took courage,
        and went on again:\u2014\u201CI didn\u2019t know that Cheshire cats always
        grinned; in fact, I didn\u2019t know that cats could grin.\u201D \u201CThey
        all can,\u201D said the Duchess; \u201Cand most of \u2019em do.\u201D \u201CI
        don\u2019t know of any that do,\u201D Alice said very politely, feeling quite
        pleased to have got into a conversation. \u201CYou don\u2019t know much,\u201D
        said the Duchess; \u201Cand that\u2019s a fact.\u201D Alice did not at all
        like the tone of this remark, and thought it would be as well to introduce
        some other subject of conversation. While she was trying to fix on one, the
        cook took the cauldron of soup off the fire, and at once set to work throwing
        everything within her reach at the Duchess and the baby\u2014the fire-irons
        came first; then followed a shower of saucepans, plates, and dishes. The
        Duchess took no notice of them even when they hit her; and the baby was howling
        so much already, that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt
        it or not. \u201COh, please mind what you\u2019re doing!\u201D cried Alice,
        jumping up and down in an agony of terror. \u201COh, there goes his precious
        nose!\u201D as an unusually large saucepan flew close by it, and very nearly
        carried it off. \u201CIf everybody minded their own business,\u201D the Duchess
        said in a hoarse growl, \u201Cthe world would go round a deal faster than
        it does.\u201D \u201CWhich would not be an advantage,\u201D said Alice, who
        felt very glad to get an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge.
        \u201CJust think of what work it would make with the day and night! You see
        the earth takes twenty-four hours to turn round on its axis\u2014\u201D\u201CTalking
        of axes,\u201D said the Duchess, \u201Cchop off her head!\u201D Alice glanced
        rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant to take the hint; but the
        cook was busily stirring the soup, and seemed not to be listening, so she
        went on again: \u201CTwenty-four hours, I think; or is it twelve? I\u2014\u201D\u201COh,
        don\u2019t bother me,\u201D said the Duchess; \u201CI never could abide figures!\u201D
        And with that she began nursing her child again, singing a sort of lullaby
        to it as she did so, and giving it a violent shake at the end of every line:
        \u201CSpeak roughly to your little boy, And beat him when he sneezes: He
        only does it to annoy, Because he knows it teases.\u201D CHORUS. (In which
        the cook and the baby joined):\u201CWow! wow! wow!\u201D While the Duchess
        sang the second verse of the song, she kept tossing the baby violently up
        and down, and the poor little thing howled so, that Alice could hardly hear
        the words:\u2014\u201CI speak severely to my boy, I beat him when he sneezes;
        For he can thoroughly enjoy The pepper when he pleases!\u201D CHORUS. \u201CWow!
        wow! wow!\u201D \u201CHere! you may nurse it a bit, if you like!\u201D the
        Duchess said to Alice, flinging the baby at her as she spoke. \u201CI must
        go and get ready to play croquet with the Queen,\u201D and she hurried out
        of the room. The cook threw a frying-pan after her as she went out, but it
        just missed her. Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a
        queer-shaped little creature, and held out its arms and legs in all directions,
        \u201Cjust like a star-fish,\u201D thought Alice. The poor little thing was
        snorting like a steam-engine when she caught it, and kept doubling itself
        up and straightening itself out again, so that altogether, for the first
        minute or two, it was as much as she could do to hold it. As soon as she
        had made out the proper way of nursing it, (which was to twist it up into
        a sort of knot, and then keep tight hold of its right ear and left foot,
        so as to prevent its undoing itself,) she carried it out into the open air.
        \u201CIf I don\u2019t take this child away with me,\u201D thought Alice,
        \u201Cthey\u2019re sure to kill it in a day or two: wouldn\u2019t it be murder
        to leave it behind?\u201D She said the last words out loud, and the little
        thing grunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time). \u201CDon\u2019t
        grunt,\u201D said Alice; \u201Cthat\u2019s not at all a proper way of expressing
        yourself.\u201D The baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into
        its face to see what was the matter with it. There could be no doubt that
        it had a very turn-up nose, much more like a snout than a real nose; also
        its eyes were getting extremely small for a baby: altogether Alice did not
        like the look of the thing at all. \u201CBut perhaps it was only sobbing,\u201D
        she thought, and looked into its eyes again, to see if there were any tears.
        No, there were no tears. \u201CIf you\u2019re going to turn into a pig, my
        dear,\u201D said Alice, seriously, \u201CI\u2019ll have nothing more to do
        with you. Mind now!\u201D The poor little thing sobbed again (or grunted,
        it was impossible to say which), and they went on for some while in silence.
        Alice was just beginning to think to herself, \u201CNow, what am I to do
        with this creature when I get it home?\u201D when it grunted again, so violently,
        that she looked down into its face in some alarm. This time there could be
        no mistake about it: it was neither more nor less than a pig, and she felt
        that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it further. So she set the
        little creature down, and felt quite relieved to see it trot away quietly
        into the wood. \u201CIf it had grown up,\u201D she said to herself, \u201Cit
        would have made a dreadfully ugly child: but it makes rather a handsome pig,
        I think.\u201D And she began thinking over other children she knew, who might
        do very well as pigs, and was just saying to herself, \u201Cif one only knew
        the right way to change them\u2014\u201D when she was a little startled by
        seeing the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off. The
        Cat only grinned when it saw Alice. It looked good-natured, she thought:
        still it had very long claws and a great many teeth, so she felt that it
        ought to be treated with respect. \u201CCheshire Puss,\u201D she began, rather
        timidly, as she did not at all know whether it would like the name: however,
        it only grinned a little wider. \u201CCome, it\u2019s pleased so far,\u201D
        thought Alice, and she went on. \u201CWould you tell me, please, which way
        I ought to go from here?\u201D \u201CThat depends a good deal on where you
        want to get to,\u201D said the Cat. \u201CI don\u2019t much care where\u2014\u201D
        said Alice. \u201CThen it doesn\u2019t matter which way you go,\u201D said
        the Cat.\u201C\u2014so long as I get somewhere,\u201D Alice added as an explanation.
        \u201COh, you\u2019re sure to do that,\u201D said the Cat, \u201Cif you only
        walk long enough.\u201D Alice felt that this could not be denied, so she
        tried another question. \u201CWhat sort of people live about here?\u201D
        \u201CIn that direction,\u201D the Cat said, waving its right paw round,
        \u201Clives a Hatter: and in that direction,\u201D waving the other paw,
        \u201Clives a March Hare. Visit either you like: they\u2019re both mad.\u201D
        \u201CBut I don\u2019t want to go among mad people,\u201D Alice remarked.
        \u201COh, you can\u2019t help that,\u201D said the Cat: \u201Cwe\u2019re
        all mad here. I\u2019m mad. You\u2019re mad.\u201D \u201CHow do you know
        I\u2019m mad?\u201D said Alice. \u201CYou must be,\u201D said the Cat, \u201Cor
        you wouldn\u2019t have come here.\u201D Alice didn\u2019t think that proved
        it at all; however, she went on \u201CAnd how do you know that you\u2019re
        mad?\u201D \u201CTo begin with,\u201D said the Cat, \u201Ca dog\u2019s not
        mad. You grant that?\u201D \u201CI suppose so,\u201D said Alice. \u201CWell,
        then,\u201D the Cat went on, \u201Cyou see, a dog growls when it\u2019s angry,
        and wags its tail when it\u2019s pleased. Now I growl when I\u2019m pleased,
        and wag my tail when I\u2019m angry. Therefore I\u2019m mad.\u201D \u201CI
        call it purring, not growling,\u201D said Alice. \u201CCall it what you like,\u201D
        said the Cat. \u201CDo you play croquet with the Queen to-day?\u201D \u201CI
        should like it very much,\u201D said Alice, \u201Cbut I haven\u2019t been
        invited yet.\u201D \u201CYou\u2019ll see me there,\u201D said the Cat, and
        vanished. Alice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used to
        queer things happening. While she was looking at the place where it had been,
        it suddenly appeared again. \u201CBy-the-bye, what became of the baby?\u201D
        said the Cat. \u201CI\u2019d nearly forgotten to ask.\u201D \u201CIt turned
        into a pig,\u201D Alice quietly said, just as if it had come back in a natural
        way. \u201CI thought it would,\u201D said the Cat, and vanished again. Alice
        waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it did not appear, and
        after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in which the March Hare
        was said to live. \u201CI\u2019ve seen hatters before,\u201D she said to
        herself; \u201Cthe March Hare will be much the most interesting, and perhaps
        as this is May it won\u2019t be raving mad\u2014at least not so mad as it
        was in March.\u201D As she said this, she looked up, and there was the Cat
        again, sitting on a branch of a tree. \u201CDid you say pig, or fig?\u201D
        said the Cat. \u201CI said pig,\u201D replied Alice; \u201Cand I wish you
        wouldn\u2019t keep appearing and vanishing so suddenly: you make one quite
        giddy.\u201D \u201CAll right,\u201D said the Cat; and this time it vanished
        quite slowly, beginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin,
        which remained some time after the rest of it had gone. \u201CWell! I\u2019ve
        often seen a cat without a grin,\u201D thought Alice; \u201Cbut a grin without
        a cat! It\u2019s the most curious thing I ever saw in my life!\u201D She
        had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house of the March
        Hare: she thought it must be the right house, because the chimneys were shaped
        like ears and the roof was thatched with fur. It was so large a house, that
        she did not like to go nearer till she had nibbled some more of the left
        hand bit of mushroom, and raised herself to about two feet high: even then
        she walked up towards it rather timidly, saying to herself \u201CSuppose
        it should be raving mad after all! I almost wish I\u2019d gone to see the
        Hatter instead!\u201D"
