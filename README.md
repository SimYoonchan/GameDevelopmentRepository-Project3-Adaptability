# GameDevelopmentRepository-Project3-AdaptiveReadingSeries
This repository is for my 3rd game development project using C# and Unity. This game was created for the intention of helping people who experienced stroke (specifically with homonymous hemianopia) to regain reading skills. The game is called "Adaptive Reading Series".
