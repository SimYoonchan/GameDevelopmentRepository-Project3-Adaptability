# GameDevelopmentRepository-Project3-Adaptability
This repository is for my 3rd game development project using C# and Unity. This game was created for the intention of helping people who experienced stroke (specifically with homonymous hemianopia) to regain reading skills. The game is called "Adaptability".
Please feel free to try out the game at https://simmer.io/@SimYoonchan/adaptability
